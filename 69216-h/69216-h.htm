</div>

<p>The rare gift of originality is denied most of us,
but a measure of compensation rests in the gift
of appreciation which has been so freely bestowed,
in some degree at least, upon nearly every one of
the human race. As one who enjoys this blessing,
the compiler of this little volume has counted it a
labor of love, and hence a delight, to gather together
during a period of forty years choice bits of humor
and quaint verse, for his own amusement and the
delectation of an inner circle of friends.</p>

<p>The growth of this collection, together with the
care used in selection, seems now to warrant its
stepping into a wider field. The same recognition of
the finer things of wit and pathos which led to these
gleanings will be met in other hearts and the smile
of kindred spirits will broaden as this little book
makes its new friends. Under the evening lamp, the
family circle may have many a hearty laugh together;
in the office or train, the tired business man may ease
the strain of concentration; in the hospitals, weary
convalescents may cheer the hours of waiting; the
after-dinner speaker may find here some worth-while
“I am reminded” stories; far and wide are scattered
the multitudes of those who will welcome the coming
of one whose mission it is to “scatter sunshine” along
life’s weary way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The gems contained in these pages have been
gathered from the <i>New York Graphic</i>, <i>Texas Siftings</i>,
<i>Ram’s Horn</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Paris Figaro</i>, <i>Punch</i>, <i>London Tit
Bits</i>, <i>Literary Digest</i>, <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i>, and from daily papers, living and dead.
To all of these, due acknowledgment is made and
confidence is expressed that one and all will endorse
the propaganda for the spread of the gospel of
laughter.</p>

<p>All of the foregoing is set down to emphasize the
simple truth that I shall regard my labor as well
rewarded, if a bit of new joy, a ray of new brightness,
may enter the life of some one who needs it today.</p>

<p>A Yorkshireman recently entered an auction
mart. Looking around and catching the auctioneer’s
eye during a lull in the bidding, he shouted loudly
enough to be heard by all: May I bid, sir?</p>

<p>Certainly, said the man of the hammer, thinking
him a customer.</p>

<p>All eyes being turned on the questioner, he,
making for the door, said:</p>

<p>Well, I’ll bid you good-night, then.</p>

<p>The laughter which followed stopped business
for some time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the sweet silence of the twilight they honey-spooned
upon the beach.</p>

<p>Dearest, she murmured, trembling, now that we
are married, I—I have a secret to tell you!</p>

<p>What is it sweetheart? he asked softly.</p>

<p>Can you ever forgive me for deceiving you? she
sobbed. My—my left eye is made of glass!</p>

<p>Never mind, lovebird, he whispered, gently; so
are the diamonds in your engagement ring!</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith presented her husband with triplets,
and two weeks later she had twins.</p>

<p>How come?</p>

<p>One of the triplets died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An inebriated husband, who has returned after
a night out, bringing with him nothing but a charlotte
russe, finds his wife very angry. I sent you
for fish last night and here you have come home
with nothing but a charlotte russe.</p>

<p>Husband (startled)—Did she come all the way
home with me?</p>

<p>An advertisement appeared in a newspaper lately
praising a new make of infant’s feeding bottle. Here
is the advice it gave relative to its use:</p>

<p>When the infant is done drinking, it must be
unscrewed and put in cold place under a tap. If
the baby does not thrive on raw milk, it should be
boiled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jenkins’ mother-in-law was buried one day last
week. Jenkins was visibly affected as he followed
the hearse.</p>

<p>Bear up, sir, said the undertaker. Don’t cry.</p>

<p>I can’t help it, sighed poor Jenkins. Poor
woman! Do you know this is the very first time
we have been out together without quarreling?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stingiest man was scoring the hired man for
his extravagance in wanting to carry a lantern in
going to call on his best girl.</p>

<p>The idea! he scoffed. When I was courtin’ I
never carried no lantern; I went in the dark.</p>

<p>The hired man proceeded to fill the lantern.</p>

<p>Yes, he said sadly, and look what you got.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Collector—When can you pay this bill?</p>

<p>Business Manager—See the puzzle editor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are you Hungary, Frances?</p>

<p>Yes, Siam.</p>

<p>Well, Russia long and I’ll Fiji.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She—John, do you think that this hat is becoming
to me?</p>

<p>He—I expect so, for the bill will be coming to me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Wade Parker—Do you take a Sunday paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. Glen Villers—We do if we get up before our
next-door neighbors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young lady was caressing a pretty spaniel, and
murmuring, I do love a nice dog! Ah! sighed a
dandy, standing near; I would I were a dog. Never
mind, retorted the young lady, sharply, you’ll grow!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Knicker—Weren’t you frightened when the
bull bellowed at you on account of your new dress?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bocker—No, it was exactly the same way
Henry behaved when he got the bill.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>English specimen (with monocle)—Aw—do you
serve lobstahs here?</p>

<p>Boston waiter—We make no unnecessary inquiries
concerning our customers, sir.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is from a retail grocer, found (not the
grocer) in a basket of Florida beans—</p>

<p>Dearest Sweet Pea—Do you carrot all for me?
My heart beets for you. With your radish hair and
turnip nose, you are the apple of my eye. Give me
a date, if we cantaloupe. Lettuce marry anyway.
I know we would make a happy pear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes, dear, I was married last month. I’d like
you to call on me and see the pretty little flat I have.</p>

<p>I’ve seen him, my dear.</p>

<p>What is the difference between a rooster, a soldier,
and a vamp?</p>

<p>The rooster says, Cock a doodle do.</p>

<p>The soldier says, Yankee doodle do.</p>

<p>And the vamp says, Any dude’ll do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prodigal son wrote the old man as follows—</p>

<p>I got religion at camp meeting the other day.
Send me ten dollars.</p>

<p>But the old man replied—</p>

<p>Religion is free. You got the wrong kind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girl was very pretty. Leaning her dimpled
elbows on the table she said—And what is your
lecture to be about, professor?</p>

<p>I shall lecture on Keats, he replied.</p>

<p>Oh, professor, she gushed, what are keats?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A pretty young lady went into a Fourth Avenue
music shop the other day. She tripped up to the
counter, where a new clerk was busy, and in her
sweetest tones asked—</p>

<p>Have you “Kissed Me in the Moonlight”?</p>

<p>No! It must have been the man at the other
counter. I’ve only been here a week.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A tall, strong man walked into a shop.</p>

<p>I want to get a set of lady’s furs, he said.</p>

<p>What kind? asked the male salesman.</p>

<p>That brown set in the window will do if it’s not
too dear, replied the tall, strong man.</p>

<p>Oh, you mean skunk? said the salesman.</p>

<p>The salesman is still in the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Fleyme—Oh, Mr. Nocoyne, how lovely of
you to bring me these beautiful roses! How sweet
they are—and how fresh! I do believe there is a
little dew on them yet!</p>

<p>Mr. Nocoyne—W-well, yes—there is; but I’ll pay
it to-morrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madam, I must request you to remove your hat,
remarked the polite theater usher.</p>

<p>The lady smiled grimly.</p>

<p>Does my hat annoy the little man behind me?</p>

<p>Yes, madam.</p>

<p>Then you’ll find it much easier to remove him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How’s this? sneered the jealous goose. How happens
it you aren’t the leading attraction at some
Thanksgiving dinner?</p>

<p>The beautiful young turkey blushed and hung her
head. Then she said softly—</p>

<p>Nobody axed me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A drummer approached a girl in charge of a soda
fountain and before giving his order asked—How is
the milkmaid to-night?</p>

<p>Milk isn’t made; it comes from cows, you fool,
was the retort. He was glad to close his mouth with
some of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No man is as well known as he thinks he is, says
Caruso. I was motoring on Long Island recently.
My car broke down and I entered a farmhouse to
get warm. The farmer and I chatted, and when he
asked my name I told him modestly that it was
Caruso. At that he threw up his hands.</p>

<p>Caruso! he exclaimed. Robinson Caruso, the
great traveler! Little did I expect ever to see a
man like yer in this here humble kitchen, sir!</p>

<p>What do you mean by an “eight-day clock?”</p>

<p>One that will run eight days without winding.</p>

<p>Huh, then how long would it run if you wound it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I sometimes wonder, said an Englishman visiting
New York, to a pretty girl sitting next to him at
dinner, what becomes of all your peaches here in
America.</p>

<p>Oh, was the reply, we eat what we can, and we
can what we can’t.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Look here! angrily exclaimed the householder,
pointing to a cigar-stump that lay on the floor of the
back porch. That was in the lump of ice you left
here yesterday morning! Well, belligerently replied
the iceman, what did you expect to get for fifteen
cents—a box of perfectos?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I, said the temperance man, strongly object to
the custom of christening ships with champagne.</p>

<p>I don’t, replied the other man. I think there’s a
temperance lesson in it.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>Well, immediately after the first bottle of wine
the ship takes to water and sticks to it ever after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man “butted in” at a waiting line before the
railroad ticket window at New York, and the men
who were in a hurry glowered.</p>

<p>I want a ticket for Boston, said the man and put
50 cents under the wicket.</p>

<p>You can’t go to Boston for 50 cents, returned the
ticket seller.</p>

<p>Well, then, asked the man, where can I go for
50 cents?</p>

<p>And each of the fourteen men in that waiting
room told him where he could go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, observed the fool man who had permitted
his wife to take him along on her search for a spring
bonnet, the hat doesn’t seem to fit. Now, I think a
woman’s hat should conform to her head the same
as a man’s.</p>

<p>Oh, tittered the merry milliner, there are no fits
connected with spring hats. They generally develop
in the men when the bill comes home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days ago, says the “<i>Newark Star</i>,” Alderman
Elmer A. Day was glancing over the register at
one of the local hotels to see if a friend of his was
registered there. Near him stood a man who was
holding onto the desk for dear life in a semi-successful
attempt to maintain his balance.</p>

<p>I s’pose you think I’m drunk? said the stranger,
looking belligerently at Day.</p>

<p>No; not in the least, replied the Alderman, anxious
to avoid the possibility of a row.</p>

<p>Well, you’d know I was if I let go this desk,
answered the man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I visited Miss Marie Corelli when I was in Stratford,
said a young woman. She lives in a quaint
house of dull red brick. She is very pretty and very
rich, and she likes Americans.</p>

<p>Miss Corelli was full of fun. She talked about
woman’s over-regard for appearances. She said that
she herself was too prone to think that, if appearances
were all right, everything was right.</p>

<p>Once, in her childhood, Miss Corelli said she was
yachting on the English coast.</p>

<p>As the yacht sped along there was a sudden
swerve, and the helmsman said—</p>

<p>By Jove, I believe she’s broken her rudder.</p>

<p>Old Smith was busy in his back yard with saw
and hatchet while his wife nursed a bad cold in the
house, when a neighbor came to the fence.</p>

<p>Good mornin’, Mr. Smith, he said. How is
Mrs. Smith this mornin’?</p>

<p>Just about the same, old Smith replied. She
didn’t sleep very well last night.</p>

<p>That’s too bad, the neighbor sympathized, and
then, as a raucous sound came from the house,
he added solicitously:</p>

<p>I s’pose that’s her coughin’, ain’t it?</p>

<p>No, old Smith answered absent-mindedly, his
eyes still on his work, it ain’t her coffin, it’s a new

<p>The world has so long been at war with the hapless
printer that it will be interesting to know that
at least one compositor has been capable of following
instructions. Once upon a time a printer brought
to Booth for inspection proof of a new poster, which
after the manner of its kind, announced the actor as
the eminent tragedian, Edwin Booth.</p>

<p>Mr. Booth did not fully approve of it.</p>

<p>I wish you’d leave out that eminent tragedian
business. I’d much rather have it simple Edwin
Booth, he said.</p>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<p>The next week the actor saw the first of his new
bills in position. His request had been carried out to
the letter. The poster announced the coming
engagement of Simple Edwin Booth.</p>

<p>We recently heard of a man who attended a
grand ball with his wife and had a grand time.
While dancing a quadrille he noticed that his pants
were ripping, and hurriedly retired to a room with
his wife, who procured a needle and thread and
began sewing up the rip. While the man was sitting
there without any pants on he heard the rustling
of skirts and it occurred to him that he had taken
refuge in the ladies’ dressing-room. He appealed to
his wife, and she shoved him to a door which opened,
as she thought, into a closet. Opening the door
quickly, she shoved him through and locked the
door. Mary! he screamed, I’m in the ballroom!
The door, instead of opening into the closet, opened
into the ballroom.</p>

<p>Here is a singular incident showing how easy

said, A trained ear, very distinctly.</p>

after nine years of married life, had left her with
four strapping boys and a generous provision of
the world’s goods. Her financial affairs were in the
hands of a trust company, the cashier of which, having
an ambition to be thought something of a wit, often
joked her when she called at the office. One day, in
opening her hand bag for a check, she thoughtlessly
dropped a pin of the variety known as safety.</p>

And while you are waiting, he added, won’t

<p>Oh, thank you, said the young lady, as he set
it down before her. The day being hot, in a few

wiping her mouth.</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes gleamed with benevolence.
The prescription, he said, tapping the glass,

<p>Do you mean to say I’ve drunk it? she screamed.
But it wasn’t for me; it was for my little brother!
And she swept from the drug store.</p>

connected with the collection of rents which used to
take him to a certain place on the eastern shore at
intervals. On one occasion he went into a store
there, the proprietor of which could neither read nor
write. While he was there a man came in who was
evidently a regular customer.</p>

<p>A man whose business troubled him greatly was
advised to advertise for an Official Worrier. He did
so, and among the applicants was a strong, serious,
impressive man.</p>

<p>Are you prepared, asked the business man, to
take over the burdens of the business?</p>

<p>I am, was the reply.</p>

<p>And what is your charge?</p>

<p>$10,000 a year.</p>

<p>Good; the job is yours. I am off for a week’s
golfing. On his return he was confronted with this
statement:</p>

<p>I have been through your books. I find that
your assets are far below your liabilities; you have
very little stock on hand; no orders; you owe a
tremendous amount of money and you are heavily
overdrawn at the bank. What I want to know is,
where am I going to get my salary from?</p>

<p>You ask me? said the business man. I should
worry about your salary. That is your job. What
do you think you are hired for?</p>

<p>There is a joke being told here at the expense of
a modest young bookkeeper which is so good it ought
to be true.</p>

<p>The young man in question, it appears, was recently
invited to a party at a residence where the
home had recently been blessed with an addition to
the family.</p>

<p>Accompanied by his best girl he met his kind
hostess at the door and after customary salutations
asked after the welfare of the baby.</p>

<p>The lady was suffering from a severe cold, which
made her slightly deaf, and she mistakenly supposed
that the young man was inquiring about her cold.</p>

<p>She replied that she usually had one every winter
but this was the worse she had ever had; it kept
her awake at night a good deal at first and confined
her to her bed.</p>

<p>Then noticing that the young bookkeeper was
becoming pale and nervous, she said that she could
see by his looks that he was going to have one just
like hers and asked him if he wished to lie down.</p>

<p>The books were posted just the same next day
but the young bookkeeper has given up inquiring
about babies.</p>

<p>Absalom Foote, an eccentric old man, who had
grown tired of life in the city, decided to move to
some smaller town, free from the roar of traffic, the
bustle and confusion of the thronging multitude,
where he could end his days tranquilly, as became a
man of his age. In casting about for a location,
his eyes chanced to light upon the advertisement in
a village paper of one Thomas R. Foote, who wanted
to dispose of his boot and shoe store at a bargain,
having made up his mind to remove to the city.</p>

<p>That’s the very thing, he said, selling shoes is a
very nice, easy occupation. It will give me just
enough to do to keep me from stagnating, and it
won’t wear me out with overwork. I’ll investigate
it. It’s queer, though, that his name is Foote, my
name is Foote, he wants to come to the city, and I
want to go to the country.</p>

<p>A visit to the little town decided him. He liked
its appearance and location. He was pleased, moreover,
with Foote’s shoe store, and bought it good
will and all, at a bargain.</p>

<p>Well, said the other Mr. Foote, you won’t have
to change the sign.</p>

<p>No, he answered slowly, I’ll just add a little to it.</p>

<p>The next day he added this, just below the sign—</p>

<p>This place has changed feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Ananias came home one night and was received
very icily by his wife. He immediately
assumed the defensive. It was not until after dinner
that he dared ask his wife what the trouble was.
Trouble, said she, why when I sent your suit to the
tailor this morning I found this memorandum in your
pocket, “Gwendolyn, Lenox 1020.”</p>

<p>Why, said Ananias, of course you know what
that means. That is a racing tip. Gwendolyn is a
horse, Lenox a jockey, and 1020 the racing odds. I
am going to the races tomorrow and will play Gwendolyn
at one to two.</p>

<p>The wife admitted her suspicions and begged
forgiveness for doubting the fidelity of her beloved
for one moment.</p>

<p>The next night Ananias came home very late
from the races. Are you asleep, he whispered to his
wife who was in bed with her face to the wall. No,
she answered in distinct and hissing tones. You had
better call up Lenox 1020, your horse wants to speak
to you.</p>

<p>Two men were waiting for a train and one said—I

own question, I will buy the tickets. Then you ask
a question, and if you can not answer your own, you
buy the tickets. The other agreed to this. Well,
the first man said, you see those rabbit-holes? How
do they dig those holes without leaving any dirt
around them? The other confessed—I don’t know.
That’s your question, so answer it yourself. The
first man winked and replied—They begin at the
bottom and dig up! But, said the second man, how
do they get at the bottom to begin? That’s your

ticket to Kansas City, inquiring the price.</p>

<p>Two twenty-five, said the agent.</p>

<p>The man dug down into a well-worn pocketbook
and fished out a bill. It was a banknote for $2.
It was also all the money he had.</p>

<p>How soon does this train go? he inquired.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, replied the agent.</p>

<p>The man hurried away. Soon he was back with
three silver dollars, with which he bought a ticket.</p>

<p>Pardon my curiosity, said the ticket seller, but
how did you get that money? It isn’t a loan, for I
see you have disposed of the $2 bill.</p>

<p>That’s all right, said the man. No, I didn’t
borrow. I went to a pawnshop and soaked the bill
for $1.50. Then as I started back here I met an old
acquaintance, to whom I sold the pawn for $1.50.
I then had $3, and he has the pawn ticket for which
the $2 bill stands as security.</p>

<p>A writer says in regard to the Prussia of fifty
years ago that it had a state lottery, and in every
town, large or small, was a collector appointed to
sell tickets. One day a servant-girl came to the
collector in Hagen and asked if she could buy
No. 23.</p>

<p>He did not have it in his possession, but as the girl
seemed very much in earnest, and refused to be put
off with any other number, he tried to obtain it
from some of the other collectors in town, and
finally succeeded.</p>

<p>The drawing took place, and Hagen rose to a
state of feverish excitement when it was known that
this girl had become a winner of a large sum of
money. She found herself for a time the chief
object of interest in the town.</p>

<p>She was, of course, asked how she came to fix
upon No. 23. Thereupon she gave this simple and
lucid explanation:</p>

<p>I dreamed one night No. 7, and the second night
I dreamed No. 7, and a third night again. So I
thought, Three times seven makes twenty-three,
and I bought that number.</p>

<p>This is the true story of a resourceful motorist.
Of the ethics of it, there is no condoning. A traffic
law in a New England city forbids the parking of
cars on the principal business street. A citizen
who understood this, was sure he could stop his

When he came out a policeman stood by his
automobile. Did the man go to his car? He did
not. He hurried to his office: He telephoned to
police headquarters: My car (giving a detailed
description) has been stolen. In a half hour this
reply: An officer has found your car. It is here
at headquarters. Come and get it. He did. Profuse

cubs he was trying to git when the she bare came up
and stopt him by eatin him up in the mountains
near your town. What i want to know is did it kill
him or was he only partly et up am he from this
place and all about the bare. I don’t know but
what he is a distant husband of mine. My first
husband was of that name and I supposed he was
killed in the war but the name of the man the bare
et being the same i thought it might be him after
all and i thought to know if he wasn’t killed either
in the war or by the bare for i have been married
twice since and their ought to be divorce papers got
out by him or me if the bare did not eat him all up.
If it is him you will know it by him having six toes
on the left foot. He also sings base and has a spread
eagle tattoed on his front chest and a ankor on his
right arm which you will know him if the bare did
not eat up these parts of him. If alive don’t tell
him I am married to J⸺ W⸺ for he
never liked J⸺. Mebbe you had better let
on as if i am ded but find out all you can about him
without him knowing anything what it is for. That
is if the bare did not eat him all up. If it did i don’t
see you can do anything and you needn’t take any
trouble. My respeks to your family and please
ancer back.</p>

<p>P. S.—Was the bare killed. Also was he married
again and did he leave any property worth me laying
claim to?</p>

<p>An advertisement in a newspaper calling for a
“first-class bookkeeper at $3 a week” drew forth the
following answer, the only one attracted by the
munificent salary.</p>

<p>I am a young man, thirty-seven years of age,
having had a business experience of twenty-three
years, being connected with the United States Embassy
at Madagascar, and feel confident if you will
give me a trial I can prove my worth to you. I am
not only an expert bookkeeper, proficient stenographer
and typewriter, excellent operator and erudite college
graduate, but have several other accomplishments
which might make me desirable. I am an experienced
snow shoveler, a first-class peanut roaster,
have some knowledge of removing superfluous hair
and clipping puppy dogs’ ears, have a medal for
reciting “Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight.” Am a
skilled chiropodist and practical farmer, can also
cook, take care of horses, crease trousers, open
oysters and repair umbrellas. Being possessed of
great physical beauty, I would not only be useful, but
would be ornamental as well, lending to the sacred
precincts of your office that delightful artistic charm
that a Satsuma vase or stuffed billy-goat would.
As to salary, I would feel I was robbing the widow
and swiping the sponge cake from the orphan if I
was to take advantage of your munificence by accepting
the too fabulous sum of $3 per week, and I
would be entirely willing to give you my services for
less, and by accepting $1.37 per week would give
you an opportunity of not only increasing your
donation to the church, pay your butcher and keep
up your life insurance, but also to found a home for
indigent fly-paper salesmen and endow a free bed
in the cat home.</p>

<p>Private John Allen takes a deep interest in the
advertising business. Advertisements that he deems
exceptionally good he clips out and pastes in a scrap-book.
As he was showing this scrap-book to a guest
one day, he said:</p>

<p>But the best ad I know of is not in here. For
it wasn’t written, but spoken. It earned its originator
some thousands of dollars, yet I can never
show it. I can only describe it, and description
fails to do it justice.</p>

<p>It was the work of a clothier in Nashville. He
had, with his partner, the first establishment in
town, and the business of the firm was considered
very prosperous. The two men had married sisters,
and their relationship was more than friendly.
Hence the greatest surprise overtook Nashville
when the junior partner suddenly took out a summons
and hauled his senior into court.</p>

<p>The senior partner is ruining the business, gossip
said. He is getting softening of the brain, or paresis,
or something of that sort. Now is the height of
the spring season, when they ought to be making
money hand over fist, but the senior’s cracked
methods are spoiling everything.</p>

<p>So all Nashville took a tremendous interest in
the case, and on the morning it was called, the
courtroom was crowded as in a murder trial.</p>

<p>The junior partner’s complaint was presented
strongly and directly. He showed that goods were
being sacrificed at a fraction of their value, and he
asked that this ruinous trading be stopped, lest
ruin ensue.</p>

<p>The defendant’s lawyer, an able fellow, secured
an adjournment for three weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>On the announcement of this adjournment, the
junior partner gave a loud groan. He leaped to
his feet, and rushed out like one demented, shouting
as he went:</p>

<p>Merciful heavens, then the sacrifice must still
go on!</p>

<p>I don’t need to tell you how much business that
firm did in the next three weeks.</p>

<p>Man, born of woman, is of a few days and no
teeth. And, indeed, it would be money in his pocket
sometimes if he had less of either. As for his days, he
wasteth one-third of them, and as for his teeth, he
has convulsions when he cuts them, and as the last
one comes through, lo, the dentist is twisting the
first one out, and the last end of that man’s jaw is
worse than the first, being full of porcelain and a
roof-plate built to hold blackberry seeds.</p>

<p>Stone bruises line his pathway to manhood; his
father boxes his ears at home, the big boys cuff him
in the play ground, and the teacher whips him in the
school-room. He buyeth Northwestern at 110, when
he hath sold short at 96, and his neighbor unloadeth
upon him Iron Mountain at 65⅝, and it straightway
breaketh down to 52¼. He riseth early and sitteth
up late that he may fill his barns and store-houses,
and lo! his children’s lawyers divide the spoil among
themselves and say, Ha, ha! He growleth and is sore
distressed because it raineth, and he beateth upon
his breast and sayeth, My crop is lost! because it
raineth not. The late rains blight his wheat and
the frost biteth his peaches. If it be so that the
sun shineth, even among the nineties, he sayeth,
Woe is me, for I perish, and if the northwest wind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
sigheth down in forty-two below he crieth, would
that I were dead! If he wear sackcloth and blue
jeans men say he is a tramp, and if he goeth forth
shaven and clad in purple and fine linen all the people
cry, shoot the dude!</p>

<p>He carrieth insurance for twenty-five years, until
he hath paid thrice over for all his goods, and then
he letteth his policy lapse one day, and that same
night fire destroyeth his store. He buildeth him a
house in Jersey, and his first born is devoured by
mosquitoes; he pitcheth his tent in New York, and
tramps devour his substance. He moveth to Kansas,
and a cyclone carrieth his house away over into
Missouri, while a prairie fire and ten million acres
of grasshoppers fight for his crop. He settleth himself
in Kentucky, and is shot the next day by a
gentleman, a colonel and a statesman, because, sah,
he resembles, sah, a man, sah, he did not like, sah.
Verily, there is no rest for the sole of his feet, and if
he had it all to do over again he would not be born
at all, for “the day of death is better than the day
of one’s birth.”</p>

<p>After a teacher had recited “The Landing of the

<p>Here is Jimmie’s essay on pants: Pants are made
for men and not for women. Women are made for
men and not for pants. When a man pants for a
woman and a woman pants for a man they are a
pair of pants. Such pants don’t last. Pants are
like molasses—they are thinner in hot weather and
thicker in cold. Men are often mistaken in pants;
such mistakes are breaches of promise. There has
been much discussion whether pants is singular or
plural. Seems to me when men wear pants it is
plural, and when they don’t wear pants it is singular.
Men go on a tear in their pants and it is all
right, but when the pants go on a tear it is all wrong.
If you want to make pants last, make the coat first.</p>

<p>The pupils of a certain school were asked to write

<p>At a public school the children were training for
the annual flag day celebration. One boy, in order
to show good reason why he should take a prominent
part in the ceremonies, said that he had a real gun;
another had a pistol; a small girl had a flag, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, one tow-haired lad of six came up to the
teacher, and stood waiting for her to see him.</p>

<p>Well, what is it? she asked.</p>

<p>I has a union suit, he said.</p>

<p>The bank teller in a snippy way said: But I don’t

<p>The woman was red-headed, and she got red-headed

I don’t need anyone to identify me. I’m the red-headed
hen next door to you whose “imps of boys”
are always running across your garden. When you
started to town this morning your wife said: Now,
Henry, if you want a dinner fit to eat this evening,

<p>George, she said, the other day those people down

it to them right away, but it didn’t satisfy them.
They’re bothering me about it again.</p>

<p>Some few days ago a Louisville banker was
approached by an impecunious farmer for a loan.
Now at times this banker is deaf for commercial purposes.
The farmer was chronically wanting to borrow,
and his security was getting shaky. I’d like to
borrow five thousand, pleaded the farmer. The
banker cupped his hand to his ear and said: Speak
a little louder and cut down the amount.</p>

<p>Thousands of girls are sent out into the world
with what is called finished educations, who cannot
even give a proper receipt for money, to say nothing
of drawing a promissory note, a draft or a bill, or
understanding the significance and importance of
business contracts.</p>

<p>Such a woman presented a check for payment to
the paying teller of her bank. He passed it back to
her with the request that she be kind enough to indorse
it. The lady wrote on the back of the check,
I have done business with this bank for many years,
and I believe it to be all right. Mrs. James B. Brown.</p>

<p>Another society woman in New York presented a
check for payment at the bank, and the teller told
her that it was not signed. Oh, do they have to be
signed? she replied. What an awful lot of red tape
there is about a banking business.</p>

<p>I know of a lady whose husband made a deposit
for her in a bank and gave her a check book so that
she could pay her bills without annoying him. One
day she received a notice from the bank that her
account was overdrawn. She went to the bank and
told the teller that there must be some mistake about
it, because she still had a lot of checks left in her book.
She knew so little about business that she thought
she could keep drawing any amount until the checks
were all gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Among the more recent stories of feminine banking
is one of a young lady who in a fit of abstraction
signed a check, Your loving Susie. A still later anecdote
is this, from one of our exchanges:</p>

<p>A fund was being raised in New York for the
benefit of sufferers by a great disaster, and a certain
rich but illiterate woman was approached upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Oh, I shouldn’t mind sending the money, she said,
but I do hate to have my name in all the papers.</p>

<p>But that could be easily arranged, said the gentleman
who had opened the subject.</p>

<p>Why, yes, of course, remarked the woman, I
could send an anonymous check. Why didn’t I think
of that before?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four or five ladies bustled into a private office
the other day.</p>

<p>What can I do for you, ladies? asked the banker
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Why, began one of the visitors, we are taking up
a subscription and we knew you wouldn’t like it if we
didn’t give you an opportunity to subscribe.</p>

<p>The banker bowed graciously and asked: And
the object? Of course it is a worthy one, or you would
not be interested in it.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, replied the spokeswoman, we think it a
very worthy object. It is to build a home for aged
and indigent widows.</p>

<p>Excellent! Excellent! I shall take pleasure in
making you out a check.</p>

<p>Oh, how lovely of you! exclaimed the spokeswoman
when she received the bit of paper and read
the amount—one hundred pounds. Oh, we didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
expect to get that much from you. We are ever so
much obliged.</p>

<p>So good of him! and similar exclamations were
heard as the check was passed around for the admiration
of the party.</p>

<p>But, said the lady who handled the check last,
you haven’t signed it.</p>

<p>That is because I do not wish my benefactions
known to the world, said the banker modestly. I
wish to give the check anonymously. And he bowed
the ladies out with great dignity.</p>

<p>In a banking office in New Orleans is an aged
bookkeeper who began his connection with the business
the day it was established. As the years went
by, the proprietor, who had started with little, but
was extremely close, amassed an enormous fortune.
The bookkeeper piled up but a small amount of savings.</p>

<p>At last the twenty-fifth anniversary of the firm
and of the bookkeeper’s services came along. He
remembered it, but thought no one else would. To
his surprise, the proprietor spoke of it at once.</p>

<p>Williams, he said, do you know what day this is?</p>

<p>Our twenty-fifth anniversary, sir.</p>

<p>It is indeed, Williams. And now I have thought
to commemorate the event, and I have put in this
envelope for you a small gift to express my appreciation
of your faithful service.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper, his hopes raised high, took the
envelope from his employer and opened it. The
token was a photograph of the employer.</p>

<p>Well? demanded the donor, as the other hesitated.
What do you want to say about it?</p>

<p>A young doctor in a country district was called
one night by an old farmer to his first case. The patient
was the farmer’s son, who was lying on the bed
in much pain. The young medico threw out his chest
and said: This should cause you no alarm. It is
nothing but a corrustified exegesis antispasmodically
emanating from the physical refrigerator, producing
a prolific source of irritability in the pericranial
epidermis.</p>

<p>The farmer looked at him and replied, just what

<p>A doctor came up to a patient in an insane asylum,
slapped him on the back and said: Well, old man,
you’re all right. You can run along and write
your folks that you’ll be back home in two weeks
as good as new.</p>

<p>The patient went off gayly to write his letter. He
had it finished and sealed, but when he was licking
the stamp it slipped through his fingers to the floor
lighted on the back of a cockroach that was passing
and stuck. The patient hadn’t seen the cockroach.
What he did see was his escaped postage stamp
zigzagging aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard,
wavering up over the baseboard and following
a crooked track up the wall and across the ceiling.
In depressed silence he tore up the letter that he
had just written and dropped the pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>Two weeks! Hell! he said. I won’t be out of
here in three years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had just hung out his shingle. That morning
a stranger entered. The doctor asked to be
excused as he hurried to the phone.</p>

<p>Taking down the receiver, he said: Yes, this
is Dr. Whoosit. Yes, will be ready for you at two-ten
this afternoon. But please be prompt, for I am
very busy. Two hundred dollars? Yes, that was
the estimate I gave you.</p>

<p>Hanging up the receiver, he turned to the stranger
and rubbing his hands asked: Now, sir, what can
I do for you?</p>

<p>Herr Doctor, my wife and I are possessed! Can’t

you? Peasant: The fighting demon; it forces us

Doctor (making three times the sign of the
cross): Begone, foul demon of discord, begone!
So that was only the preliminary cure, now I will

After ten minutes the first one is to come in again,

<p>A prominent lawyer of New York says that many
years ago he went West, but as he got no clients, and
stood a good chance of starving, he decided to come
East again. Without any money he boarded a train
for Nashville, Tenn., intending to seek employment
as reporter on one of the daily newspapers, says the
<i>New York Telegraph</i>. When the conductor called for
his ticket, he said—</p>

<p>I am on the staff of the ⸺ of Nashville. I
suppose you will pass me.</p>

<p>The conductor looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>The editor of that paper is in the smoker; come
with me; if he identifies you, all right.</p>

<p>He followed the conductor into the smoker; the
situation was explained. Mr. Editor said—</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I recognize him as one of the staff; it is
all right.</p>

<p>Before leaving the train the lawyer again sought
the editor.</p>

<p>Why did you say you recognized me? I’m not
on your paper.</p>

<p>I’m not the editor either. I’m traveling on his pass,

<p>Harry Bulger has recently added to his repertoire
of stories a new character vignette which has been
received with laughter in the South. As Mr. Bulger
will be the guest of the Forty Club in Chicago during
the “Woodland” engagement in that city, he is
reserving this story for the post-prandial gossip.</p>

<p>It relates largely to a lawyer and a Jewish client
during a civil action. The attorney, watching the
evidence and the countenance of the Judge, whose
reputation for severity was well known in the district,
whispered to his Hebrew client.</p>

<p>It looks very bad. We are going to lose the case.
Whereupon the client responded.</p>

<p>Vell, I will send the Judge a box of cigars.</p>

<p>Great heavens, no! That would end it.</p>

<p>The following day much to the surprise of the
plaintiff’s attorney, the decision was rendered for his
client. Meeting his Jewish friend later the lawyer
exclaimed—</p>

<p>By Jove, I cannot understand this decision. Beats
anything I ever heard. Tell me, did you send the
Judge a box of cigars?</p>

<p>Certainly. Of course I did.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Yes, but I sent it with the card of the other fellow
in it.</p>

<p>There was once a clergyman’s son, who was
educated for the ministry. He finished his theological
course at Oxford and returned home with
the Oxford accent. On the following Sunday he
was invited to fill his father’s pulpit for the morning
service. The young preacher announced his text
as follows: And they wequiahed of him Bawabbas.
Now Bawabbas was a wobbah. At the evening
service the old man resumed his pulpit and preached
an eloquent sermon from the text, O Lord, have
mercy upon us, for this my son is lunatic and we
are sore distressed.</p>

<p>Upon the conclusion of his remarks the minister
had added: I regret to inform you, brethren that my
dog, who appears to be particularly fond of paper,
this morning ate that portion of my sermon that I
have not delivered.</p>

<p>After the service, the clergyman was met at the

<p>A clergyman preached a rather long sermon from
the text, Thou art weighed in the balance and found
wanting. After the congregation had listened about
an hour, some began to get weary and went out;
others soon followed, greatly to the annoyance of the
minister. Another person started, whereupon the
preacher stopped his sermon and said: That is right
gentlemen; as fast as you are weighed, pass out! He
continued his sermon some time after that, but no

<p>Not a few preachers would be glad to be the
victims of such a practical joke as was recently played
upon the Rev. Mr. Hageman, of Oxford, Mich. At
the annual meeting of the church of which he is pastor
the question of hiring a preacher comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>At the last meeting of this society, when the subject
was brought up, a good deacon arose and said:
All those in favor of retaining Brother Hageman for
another year—at the same salary—will please rise.</p>

<p>Not a person rose, and the minister, who was
present, felt as uncomfortable as possible, and heartily
wished himself anywhere else. Then the good deacon
who had put the question arose again and said, with
a twinkle of the eye:</p>

<p>I see not one favors that motion, so I will put it
again in this way: All those in favor of keeping the
Rev. Mr. Hageman—at an increased salary—will
please rise.</p>

<p>Everyone got upon his feet. Then it dawned upon
Mr. Hageman that he had been the victim of a
joke, and a smile lighted his eye, and the color returned
to his cheeks. Some of his best friends had
planned the surprise, and the little scheme had worked
to perfection.</p>

voice, open a couple of windows on each side of the

the sexton, with a look of great surprise. Did I
understand you to say, open the windows? It is
a very bitter cold night, sir. Yes, I am well aware

<p>That Henry Ward Beecher was spared much embarrassment
by his quickness at repartee is illustrated
by the following story:</p>

<p>One evening as he was in the midst of an impassioned
speech some one attempted to interrupt him
by suddenly crowing like a rooster. It was done to
perfection; a number of people laughed in spite of
themselves, and the speaker’s friends felt that in a
moment the whole effect of the meeting, and of Mr.
Beecher’s thrilling appeals might be lost. The orator,
however, was equal to the occasion. He stopped,
listened till the crowing ceased, and then, with a look
of surprise, pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>Morning already, he said; my watch is only at 10.
But there can be no mistake about it. The instincts
of the lower animals are infallible.</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter. The lower animal
in the gallery collapsed, and Mr. Beecher was able to
resume as if nothing had occurred.</p>

this story, told on his recent visit to a Methodist convention

<p>According to Senator Gore, there was an accomplished
hen with a brood of chickens—five roosters
and five pullets. The chicks matured and went their
various ways, while the mother hen busied herself
with a new brood. In course of time Methodist
ministers came into the vicinity of Chickenville to
hold a conference, and, as might be suspected, the
five young roosters, fat, yellow-legged and extremely
tender, were feasted upon by various and sundry
preachers. The young pullets, left behind, were met
by the mother hen a few days later. My children,
she asked, where are your brothers?</p>

<p>Sunday School Superintendent—Who led the children
of Israel into Canaan? Will one of the smaller
boys answer?</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>Superintendent (sternly)—Can no one tell?
You little fellow on that seat next to the aisle, who
led the children of Israel into Canaan?</p>

<p>Little Boy (badly frightened)—It wasn’t me.
I—I just moved here last week from Missouri.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred at the close of Sam
Jones’ sermon at Pulaski. Stepping down from the
pulpit, folding his hands across his breast, and looking
solemnly over the audience, the great revivalist
said—</p>

<p>I want all the women in this crowd who have not
spoken a harsh word or harbored an unkind thought
toward their husbands for a month past to stand up.</p>

<p>One old woman, apparently on the shady side of
sixty, stood up.</p>

<p>Come forward and give me your hand, said the
preacher.</p>

<p>The woman did so, whereupon Jones said—</p>

<p>Now turn around and let this audience see the
best-looking woman in the country.</p>

<p>After taking her seat, the revivalist addressed the
men—</p>

<p>Now I want all the men in this crowd who have
not spoken a harsh word or harbored an unkind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
thought toward their wives for a month past to
stand up.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven great big strapping fellows hopped
out of the audience with all the alacrity of champagne
corks.</p>

<p>Come forward and give me your hands, my dear
boys.</p>

<p>Jones gave each one a vigorous shake, after which
he ranged all of them side by side in front of the
pulpit and facing the audience. He looked them
over carefully and solemnly, and then, turning around
to the audience, he said—</p>

<p>I want you all to take a good look at the twenty-seven
biggest liars in the State of Tennessee.</p>

<p>General W. W. Blackmar was talking to a group

Go along with you. You can’t fool us.</p>

It reminds me of the frauds that were practiced in

<p>At a country fair in my youth there was a show
devoted almost to biblical relics. I wish you could
have seen the faded cloth, the rusty nails, and the
brass jewels that did duty severally for a piece of
Solomon’s robe, an earring of the Queen of Sheba,
Absalom’s hairpin, David’s sling, and so on. In the
place of honor hung a sword, and the showman
said—</p>

<p>This is the sword that Balaam was going to kill
his ass with.</p>

<p>When I was a little child, the sergeant sweetly
addressed his men at the end of an hour’s exhaustive
drill, I had a set of wooden soldiers. There was a
poor little boy in the neighborhood and after I had
been to Sunday school one day and listened to a
stirring talk on the beauties of charity I was softened
enough to give them to him. Then I wanted them
back and cried, but mother said, Don’t cry, Bertie,

set of certified rolling pins, that day has come.</p>

<p>The Baron Speck von Sternberg, the newly appointed

The German’s courage was pretty severely attacked
by an Englishman. Baron von Sternberg took revenge
on him with this brief story—</p>

<p>An Englishman and a German were to fight a
duel. They were locked in a pitch dark room
together with cocked pistols. All was still, and
neither could tell where the other was. Finally the
German, not wishing to have murder on his soul,
tiptoed to the chimney and fired up it. There was

Adolphus appeared on the scene, accompanied by a

<p>You see those two men? Immediately after their
duel you will behead the survivor.</p>

sat down beside Tanner and talked religion to him

days in Ireland. Pat had served part of his time
as a bricklayer in the old country. On arrival in

work when the foreman observed him:</p>

<p>Can they do it as quick as that in Ireland, Pat?</p>

<p>They can indeed, and twice as quick, answered Pat.</p>

<p>Do you know, said the foreman, that we start
a house here in the morning and it’s finished and
a tenant in it before evening.</p>

<p>That’s all you can do, is it? Well, said Pat,

<p>Strange as it may seem, there is a public man in
this city who is blessed or cursed with a tender conscience
that worries him in small matters as well as

to himself is the bidding a servant to say he is not at
home when, in reality, he is inside his house. At
the same time he is not able to receive the many
visitors who call upon him, and his only recourse was
to give instructions that polite excuses should be
given to a maid, an Irish girl, gifted with the readiness
and good-will of her nation.</p>

<p>Then I’m to be saying, sir, that you’re not at
home? the maid inquired.</p>

<p>No, Mary, no! was the reply; that would not be
true. If anyone should ask for me, you must just
put him off—give him some evasive answer, you know.</p>

<p>I’ll do it, sir, never fear, was the maid’s reply.
Mary was as good as her word.</p>

<p>That afternoon a person of importance made his
appearance, and was duly sent away. The faithful
maid reported the circumstance to her employer.</p>

<p>What did you do, Mary? inquired the latter with
some trepidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>Oh, I just put him off, sir, as you told me. I
gave him an evasive answer.</p>

After thinking the matter over he finally decided to

he inquired upon being given the proper number.
Yes, it’s me, returned the lady. Will you marry me,
Samantha, and marry me quick? Yes, I will, was

Why, Rastus, that horse ain’t no good at all. He

<p>One morning, while visiting in Richmond, a New

between the hostess and the cook—</p>

<p>Please, Mis’ Gawdon, may I git off nex’ Sunday
to go to the fun’ral of a friend of mine?</p>

<p>Next Sunday? Why, Eliza, this is only Monday!
They wouldn’t put a funeral off for a week.</p>

<p>Yas’m, respectfully; but dey has to, ’cause he
ain’t dead yit.</p>

<p>Not dead! I am positively ashamed of you.
How can you be so heartless as to arrange to attend
the funeral of a man who is still living? Why, he
may not die at all.</p>

<p>Yas’m, but he will; dey ain’t no hope.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say that, Eliza; the best doctors
are often mistaken. But even if they do know
a case to be hopeless, they cannot predict the exact
time of a man’s death with such a certainty that the
funeral can be arranged so long beforehand.</p>

<p>Yas’m, with calm assurance; but he will be buried
nex’ Sunday, for all dat, ’cause he’s gwin’ to be hung
on Friday.</p>

<p>When General John Corson Smith was lieutenant
governor of Illinois, one of the colored janitors of the
state house at Springfield came into his office one
morning and related the following incident, which he
said occurred the previous evening in the negro lodge
of which he was a member—</p>

<p>The ballot box had been passed and the worshipful
master asked—How is the ballot in the south,
Brother Junior Warden? Clar in the south, worshipful.
How is the ballot in the west, Brother Senior
Warden? Clar in the west, worshipful. The W. M.
then inspected the box and said—And clar in the
east. I therefore declar Mr. Josephus Johnson duly
elected to take the degrees in this lodge. Up jumped
a big coon, as black as the ace of spades, and cried,
That’s a ’fernal lie,’ worshipful master. I put in
four black balls myself.</p>

<p>A negro boy walked into a drug store and asked
permission to use the telephone. Then the following

<p>Is that you, Mistah Jones?</p>

<p>Yes, apparently was the reply.</p>

<p>Well, Mistah Jones, I saw your ad in de paper

<p>Yes, seemed to be the answer again.</p>

<p>Well, Mistah Jones, is he givin’ perfect satisfaction?</p>

<p>The reply appeared still to be affirmative.</p>

<p>Well, Mistah Jones, providen dis cullud boy don’t
give perfect satisfaction, you call me at 54.</p>

<p>The boy turned and started out, and the druggist,
who had overheard, remarked—You didn’t do any

<p>Edward M. Flesh, of the United States Food
Commission, was talking in St. Louis about snobbishness.</p>

<p>Snobbishness penetrates everywhere, he said. It
even penetrates our churches.</p>

<p>I know of an old darky who got religion last
month and decided to join the church. He selected,
of course, the richest and handsomest church in
town, the church with the finest music and the best
preaching. Then he called on the pastor and stated
his design.</p>

<p>But the pastor hemmed and hawed. He felt that
his fashionable flock wouldn’t welcome such an addition
as the old darky. He didn’t want to hurt the
old fellow’s feelings, however, and finally he said—</p>

<p>Go home, Uncle Rooster. Go home and pray
over it. This is an important matter, and it should
be made a subject of prayer.</p>

<p>Old Uncle Rooster went home, and in a few days
he was back again.</p>

<p>Well? said the divine. Well, what’s the verdict
now?</p>

<p>Ah prayed an’ Ah prayed, said Uncle Rooster, an’
de good Lawd He say to me, Rooster, mah son, Ah
wouldn’t bothah mah haid about dat mattah no mo.’

<p>At the end of the first six months of his pastorate
in Kentucky the Rev. Silas Johns had learned the
ways of his flock so thoroughly that he knew exactly
how to deal with them. One Sunday the collection
was deplorably small. The next week he made a
short and telling speech at the close of his sermon.
I don’t want any man to gib more dan his share,
bredren, he said, gently, bending toward the congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
but we must all gib according as we are
favored and according to what we rightly hab. I
say rightly hab, bredren, he went on, after a short
pause, because we don’t want any tainted money in
de box. Squire Blinks told me dat he’d missed some
chickens dis week. Now, if any one ob my pore
benighted bredren has fallen by de way in connection
wid does chickens, let him stay his hand from de
box when it comes to him. Brudder Mose, will you
pass de box while I watch de signs and see if dere’s
one in de congregation dat needs me to wrestle in
prayer for him?</p>

<p>An excellent story is told by Kate Douglas Wiggin,
the popular writer. A negro servant, wishing
to get married, asked his master to buy him a license
in the neighboring town. The master, being in haste,
did not ask the name of the happy woman, but as he
drove along he reflected on the many tender attentions
that he had seen John lavish upon Euphemia
Wilson, the cook, and, concluding that there could
be no mistake, had the license made out in her name.</p>

<p>There’s your license to marry Euphemia, he said
to the servant that night. You’re as good as married
already, and you owe me only two dollars.</p>

<p>The darky’s face fell.</p>

<p>But, Mas’ Tom, Euphemia Wilson ain’t de lady
I’se gwine to marry. Dat wan’t nothin’ mo’n a
little flirtation. Georgiana Thompson, the la’ndress,
is the one I’se gwine to marry.</p>

<p>Oh, well, John, said the master, amused and
irritated at the same time, there’s no great harm
done. I’ll get you another license to-morrow, but
it will cost you two dollars more, of course.</p>

<p>The next morning the darky came out to the
carriage as it was starting for town, and leaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
confidentially over the wheel, said—Mas’ Tom, you
needn’t git me no udder license; I’ll use the one I’se
got. I’se been t’inkin’ it over in de night, an’ to
tell you de troof, Mas’ Tom, de conclusion o’ my
jedgment is dat dar ain’t two dollars’ worth o’
diff’rence between dem two ladies.</p>

<p>Until recently there was a partnership existing
between two darky blacksmiths in an Alabama town.
The dissolution of this association was made known
by a notice nailed upon the door of the smithy, which
notice ran as follows—</p>

<p>The kopardnershipp heretofor resisting between
me and Mose Jenkins is heerby resolved. All perrsons
owing the firm will settel with me, and all
perrsons that the firm owes to will settel with Mose.</p>

<p>An old farmer of Arkansas, whose sons had all
grown up and left him, hired a young man by the
name of Esau Buck to help him on his farm. On
the evening of the first day they hauled up a small
load of poles for wood, and unloaded them. The
next morning the old man said to the hired man—</p>

<p>Esau, I’m going to town today, and while I am
gone you may saw wood and keep the old ram out
of the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>When the old man had gone, Esau went out to
saw the wood, but when he saw the saw he wouldn’t
saw. When Esau saw the saw he couldn’t saw with
that saw. Esau looked around for another saw, but
that was the only saw he saw, so he didn’t saw.
When the old man came home he said to Esau—</p>

<p>Esau, did you saw the wood?</p>

<p>Esau said—I saw the wood, but I wouldn’t saw it.</p>

<p>The old man went out to see the saw, and when
he saw the saw he saw that Esau couldn’t saw with
that saw. When Esau saw that the old man saw
that he couldn’t saw with the saw, Esau picked up
the ax and chopped up the wood and made a seesaw.</p>

<p>The next day the old man went to town and bought
a new buck-saw for Esau Buck, and when he came
home he hung the buck-saw for Esau Buck on the
saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>Just at that time Esau Buck saw the old buck in
the garden eating cabbage, and when driving him
from the garden to the barn-yard Esau Buck saw
the buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>When the old buck saw Esau Buck looking at the
new buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw, he
made a dive for Esau, hit the seesaw, knocked the
seesaw against Esau Buck, who fell on the buck-saw
on the saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>When the old man saw the old buck dive at Esau
Buck, and miss Esau and hit the seesaw and knock
the seesaw against Esau, and Esau Buck fall on the
buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw, he picked
up an ax to kill the old buck. But the buck saw
him coming and dodged the blow and countered on
the old man’s stomach, knocked the old man over
the seesaw onto Esau Buck, who was getting the
seesaw, crippled Esau Buck, broke the buck-saw and
the saw-buck and the seesaw.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<p>The rare gift of originality is denied most of us,
but a measure of compensation rests in the gift
of appreciation which has been so freely bestowed,
in some degree at least, upon nearly every one of
the human race. As one who enjoys this blessing,
the compiler of this little volume has counted it a
labor of love, and hence a delight, to gather together
during a period of forty years choice bits of humor
and quaint verse, for his own amusement and the
delectation of an inner circle of friends.</p>

<p>The growth of this collection, together with the
care used in selection, seems now to warrant its
stepping into a wider field. The same recognition of
the finer things of wit and pathos which led to these
gleanings will be met in other hearts and the smile
of kindred spirits will broaden as this little book
makes its new friends. Under the evening lamp, the
family circle may have many a hearty laugh together;
in the office or train, the tired business man may ease
the strain of concentration; in the hospitals, weary
convalescents may cheer the hours of waiting; the
after-dinner speaker may find here some worth-while
“I am reminded” stories; far and wide are scattered
the multitudes of those who will welcome the coming
of one whose mission it is to “scatter sunshine” along
life’s weary way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The gems contained in these pages have been
gathered from the <i>New York Graphic</i>, <i>Texas Siftings</i>,
<i>Ram’s Horn</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Paris Figaro</i>, <i>Punch</i>, <i>London Tit
Bits</i>, <i>Literary Digest</i>, <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i>, and from daily papers, living and dead.
To all of these, due acknowledgment is made and
confidence is expressed that one and all will endorse
the propaganda for the spread of the gospel of
laughter.</p>

<p>All of the foregoing is set down to emphasize the
simple truth that I shall regard my labor as well
rewarded, if a bit of new joy, a ray of new brightness,
may enter the life of some one who needs it today.</p>

<p>Motto for young lovers: Sofa and no father.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I would like some powder, please, said the young
miss to the drugstore clerk.</p>

<p>Yes, miss. Face, gun or bug?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Diner (Scanning menu)—Have you frog legs?</p>

<p>Waitress—Oh, no sir! I walk this way on account
of rheumatism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The new long skirts may make the women appear
taller, but there is no denying that the short skirts
make the men look longer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Village Constable (to villager who has been
knocked down by passing motorist): You didn’t
see the number, but could you swear to the man?</p>

<p>Villager: I did, but I don’t think ’e ’eard me.</p>

<p>Messenger boy, with a telegram for Mr. Jenkins,

<p>He—I feel like thirty cents.</p>

<p>She—How things have gone up since the war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paw, said Tommy Tucker, am I descended from
the monkey? Not on my side of the house, replied
Mr. Tucker, with much positiveness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Reformer would change the name of Hollywood
to Follywood.</p>

<p>The Hellywood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Farmer—See here, young feller, what are you
doing up that tree?</p>

<p>Boy—One of your apples fell down and I’m
trying to put it back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Yorkshireman recently entered an auction
mart. Looking around and catching the auctioneer’s
eye during a lull in the bidding, he shouted loudly
enough to be heard by all: May I bid, sir?</p>

<p>Certainly, said the man of the hammer, thinking
him a customer.</p>

<p>All eyes being turned on the questioner, he,
making for the door, said:</p>

<p>Well, I’ll bid you good-night, then.</p>

<p>The laughter which followed stopped business
for some time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the sweet silence of the twilight they honey-spooned
upon the beach.</p>

<p>Dearest, she murmured, trembling, now that we
are married, I—I have a secret to tell you!</p>

<p>What is it sweetheart? he asked softly.</p>

<p>Can you ever forgive me for deceiving you? she
sobbed. My—my left eye is made of glass!</p>

<p>Never mind, lovebird, he whispered, gently; so
are the diamonds in your engagement ring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Smith presented her husband with triplets,
and two weeks later she had twins.</p>

<p>How come?</p>

<p>One of the triplets died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An inebriated husband, who has returned after
a night out, bringing with him nothing but a charlotte
russe, finds his wife very angry. I sent you
for fish last night and here you have come home
with nothing but a charlotte russe.</p>

<p>Husband (startled)—Did she come all the way
home with me?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An advertisement appeared in a newspaper lately
praising a new make of infant’s feeding bottle. Here
is the advice it gave relative to its use:</p>

<p>When the infant is done drinking, it must be
unscrewed and put in cold place under a tap. If
the baby does not thrive on raw milk, it should be
boiled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jenkins’ mother-in-law was buried one day last
week. Jenkins was visibly affected as he followed
the hearse.</p>

<p>Bear up, sir, said the undertaker. Don’t cry.</p>

<p>I can’t help it, sighed poor Jenkins. Poor
woman! Do you know this is the very first time
we have been out together without quarreling?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stingiest man was scoring the hired man for
his extravagance in wanting to carry a lantern in
going to call on his best girl.</p>

<p>The idea! he scoffed. When I was courtin’ I
never carried no lantern; I went in the dark.</p>

<p>The hired man proceeded to fill the lantern.</p>

<p>Yes, he said sadly, and look what you got.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Collector—When can you pay this bill?</p>

<p>Business Manager—See the puzzle editor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are you Hungary, Frances?</p>

<p>Yes, Siam.</p>

<p>Well, Russia long and I’ll Fiji.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She—John, do you think that this hat is becoming
to me?</p>

<p>He—I expect so, for the bill will be coming to me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Wade Parker—Do you take a Sunday paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. Glen Villers—We do if we get up before our
next-door neighbors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young lady was caressing a pretty spaniel, and
murmuring, I do love a nice dog! Ah! sighed a
dandy, standing near; I would I were a dog. Never
mind, retorted the young lady, sharply, you’ll grow!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Knicker—Weren’t you frightened when the
bull bellowed at you on account of your new dress?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bocker—No, it was exactly the same way
Henry behaved when he got the bill.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>English specimen (with monocle)—Aw—do you
serve lobstahs here?</p>

<p>Boston waiter—We make no unnecessary inquiries
concerning our customers, sir.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is from a retail grocer, found (not the
grocer) in a basket of Florida beans—</p>

<p>Dearest Sweet Pea—Do you carrot all for me?
My heart beets for you. With your radish hair and
turnip nose, you are the apple of my eye. Give me
a date, if we cantaloupe. Lettuce marry anyway.
I know we would make a happy pear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes, dear, I was married last month. I’d like
you to call on me and see the pretty little flat I have.</p>

<p>I’ve seen him, my dear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the difference between a rooster, a soldier,
and a vamp?</p>

<p>The rooster says, Cock a doodle do.</p>

<p>The soldier says, Yankee doodle do.</p>

<p>And the vamp says, Any dude’ll do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prodigal son wrote the old man as follows—</p>

<p>I got religion at camp meeting the other day.
Send me ten dollars.</p>

<p>But the old man replied—</p>

<p>Religion is free. You got the wrong kind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girl was very pretty. Leaning her dimpled
elbows on the table she said—And what is your
lecture to be about, professor?</p>

<p>I shall lecture on Keats, he replied.</p>

<p>Oh, professor, she gushed, what are keats?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A pretty young lady went into a Fourth Avenue
music shop the other day. She tripped up to the
counter, where a new clerk was busy, and in her
sweetest tones asked—</p>

<p>Have you “Kissed Me in the Moonlight”?</p>

<p>No! It must have been the man at the other
counter. I’ve only been here a week.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A tall, strong man walked into a shop.</p>

<p>I want to get a set of lady’s furs, he said.</p>

<p>What kind? asked the male salesman.</p>

<p>That brown set in the window will do if it’s not
too dear, replied the tall, strong man.</p>

<p>Oh, you mean skunk? said the salesman.</p>

<p>The salesman is still in the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Fleyme—Oh, Mr. Nocoyne, how lovely of
you to bring me these beautiful roses! How sweet
they are—and how fresh! I do believe there is a
little dew on them yet!</p>

<p>Mr. Nocoyne—W-well, yes—there is; but I’ll pay
it to-morrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madam, I must request you to remove your hat,
remarked the polite theater usher.</p>

<p>The lady smiled grimly.</p>

<p>Does my hat annoy the little man behind me?</p>

<p>Yes, madam.</p>

<p>Then you’ll find it much easier to remove him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How’s this? sneered the jealous goose. How happens
it you aren’t the leading attraction at some
Thanksgiving dinner?</p>

<p>The beautiful young turkey blushed and hung her
head. Then she said softly—</p>

<p>Nobody axed me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A drummer approached a girl in charge of a soda
fountain and before giving his order asked—How is
the milkmaid to-night?</p>

<p>Milk isn’t made; it comes from cows, you fool,
was the retort. He was glad to close his mouth with
some of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No man is as well known as he thinks he is, says
Caruso. I was motoring on Long Island recently.
My car broke down and I entered a farmhouse to
get warm. The farmer and I chatted, and when he
asked my name I told him modestly that it was
Caruso. At that he threw up his hands.</p>

<p>Caruso! he exclaimed. Robinson Caruso, the
great traveler! Little did I expect ever to see a
man like yer in this here humble kitchen, sir!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What do you mean by an “eight-day clock?”</p>

<p>One that will run eight days without winding.</p>

<p>Huh, then how long would it run if you wound it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I sometimes wonder, said an Englishman visiting
New York, to a pretty girl sitting next to him at
dinner, what becomes of all your peaches here in
America.</p>

<p>Oh, was the reply, we eat what we can, and we
can what we can’t.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Look here! angrily exclaimed the householder,
pointing to a cigar-stump that lay on the floor of the
back porch. That was in the lump of ice you left
here yesterday morning! Well, belligerently replied
the iceman, what did you expect to get for fifteen
cents—a box of perfectos?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I, said the temperance man, strongly object to
the custom of christening ships with champagne.</p>

<p>I don’t, replied the other man. I think there’s a
temperance lesson in it.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>Well, immediately after the first bottle of wine
the ship takes to water and sticks to it ever after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man “butted in” at a waiting line before the
railroad ticket window at New York, and the men
who were in a hurry glowered.</p>

<p>I want a ticket for Boston, said the man and put
50 cents under the wicket.</p>

<p>You can’t go to Boston for 50 cents, returned the
ticket seller.</p>

<p>Well, then, asked the man, where can I go for
50 cents?</p>

<p>And each of the fourteen men in that waiting
room told him where he could go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, observed the fool man who had permitted
his wife to take him along on her search for a spring
bonnet, the hat doesn’t seem to fit. Now, I think a
woman’s hat should conform to her head the same
as a man’s.</p>

<p>Oh, tittered the merry milliner, there are no fits
connected with spring hats. They generally develop
in the men when the bill comes home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days ago, says the “<i>Newark Star</i>,” Alderman
Elmer A. Day was glancing over the register at
one of the local hotels to see if a friend of his was
registered there. Near him stood a man who was
holding onto the desk for dear life in a semi-successful
attempt to maintain his balance.</p>

<p>I s’pose you think I’m drunk? said the stranger,
looking belligerently at Day.</p>

<p>No; not in the least, replied the Alderman, anxious
to avoid the possibility of a row.</p>

<p>Well, you’d know I was if I let go this desk,
answered the man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I visited Miss Marie Corelli when I was in Stratford,
said a young woman. She lives in a quaint
house of dull red brick. She is very pretty and very
rich, and she likes Americans.</p>

<p>Miss Corelli was full of fun. She talked about
woman’s over-regard for appearances. She said that
she herself was too prone to think that, if appearances
were all right, everything was right.</p>

<p>Once, in her childhood, Miss Corelli said she was
yachting on the English coast.</p>

<p>As the yacht sped along there was a sudden
swerve, and the helmsman said—</p>

<p>By Jove, I believe she’s broken her rudder.</p>

<p>Oh, well, said the young girl, what does it matter?
It’s under water, and I’m sure nobody will notice it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A sentimental novelist once wrote: Edwin then
kissed Angelina under the silent stars.</p>

<p>The compositor set it up thus:</p>

<p>Edwin then kicked Angelina under the cellar
stairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Old Smith was busy in his back yard with saw
and hatchet while his wife nursed a bad cold in the
house, when a neighbor came to the fence.</p>

<p>Good mornin’, Mr. Smith, he said. How is
Mrs. Smith this mornin’?</p>

<p>Just about the same, old Smith replied. She
didn’t sleep very well last night.</p>

<p>That’s too bad, the neighbor sympathized, and
then, as a raucous sound came from the house,
he added solicitously:</p>

<p>I s’pose that’s her coughin’, ain’t it?</p>

<p>No, old Smith answered absent-mindedly, his
eyes still on his work, it ain’t her coffin, it’s a new
hen house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The world has so long been at war with the hapless
printer that it will be interesting to know that
at least one compositor has been capable of following
instructions. Once upon a time a printer brought
to Booth for inspection proof of a new poster, which
after the manner of its kind, announced the actor as
the eminent tragedian, Edwin Booth.</p>

<p>Mr. Booth did not fully approve of it.</p>

<p>I wish you’d leave out that eminent tragedian
business. I’d much rather have it simple Edwin
Booth, he said.</p>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<p>The next week the actor saw the first of his new
bills in position. His request had been carried out to
the letter. The poster announced the coming
engagement of Simple Edwin Booth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>I left my husband’s death notice here this morning,
said the widow.</p>

<p>Yes, said the bright clerk in the publication
room of the “Daily Squib.”</p>

<p>Now, continued the widow, I want you to add to

<p>Miss Frances Kellar, of the Woman’s Municipal
League of New York, illustrated admirably at a
dinner party a point which she wished to make.</p>

<p>Women, a man has said, are vainer than men.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Kellar answered, I admit that
women are vain and men are not. There are a
thousand proofs that this is so. Why, the necktie
of the handsomest man in the room is even now up
the back of his collar.</p>

<p>There were six men present, and each of them
put his hand gently behind his neck.</p>

<p>We recently heard of a man who attended a
grand ball with his wife and had a grand time.
While dancing a quadrille he noticed that his pants
were ripping, and hurriedly retired to a room with
his wife, who procured a needle and thread and
began sewing up the rip. While the man was sitting
there without any pants on he heard the rustling
of skirts and it occurred to him that he had taken
refuge in the ladies’ dressing-room. He appealed to
his wife, and she shoved him to a door which opened,
as she thought, into a closet. Opening the door
quickly, she shoved him through and locked the
door. Mary! he screamed, I’m in the ballroom!
The door, instead of opening into the closet, opened
into the ballroom.</p>

Simeon Strunsky in the New York Evening Post.</p>

<p>The next day it printed the following notice:</p>

<p>A matron of the most determined character
was encountered by a young woman reporter on a
country paper, who was sent out to interview leading
citizens as to their politics. May I see Mr. ⸺?
she asked of a stern-looking woman who opened the
door at one house. No, you can’t, answered the matron
decisively. But I want to know what party
he belongs to, pleaded the girl. The woman drew

<p>Here is a singular incident showing how easy
it is to mistranslate an overheard remark.</p>

<p>Said Mrs. A, one of the overhearers: They
must have been to the zoo, because I heard her mention
a trained deer.</p>

<p>Said Mrs. B: No, no. They were talking
about going away and she said to him, find out
about the train, dear.</p>

<p>Said Mrs. C: I think you are both wrong. It
seemed to me they were discussing music, for she
said, A trained ear, very distinctly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the lady herself appeared
and they told her of their disagreement.</p>

<p>Well, she laughed, that’s certainly funny. You
are poor guessers, all of you. The fact is, I’d been
out to the country overnight and I was asking my
husband if it rained here last evening.</p>

<p>She was a pretty little widow, whose husband,
after nine years of married life, had left her with
four strapping boys and a generous provision of
the world’s goods. Her financial affairs were in the
hands of a trust company, the cashier of which, having
an ambition to be thought something of a wit, often
joked her when she called at the office. One day, in
opening her hand bag for a check, she thoughtlessly
dropped a pin of the variety known as safety.</p>

<p>The cashier, noticing this, jocosely asked:</p>

<p>Is that your fraternity pin?</p>

<p>To which the little widow replied:</p>

<p>No, it’s my maternity pin.</p>

<p>Can you tell me, said the cool-looking young
lady in white, confidentially approaching the young
man at the soda fountain, the most agreeable way
to take castor oil?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, indeed, replied the man, his eyes brightening.
And while you are waiting, he added, won’t
you have a glass of soda?</p>

<p>Oh, thank you, said the young lady, as he set
it down before her. The day being hot, in a few
moments she had drained the glass.</p>

<p>Is the prescription ready? she asked, sweetly,
wiping her mouth.</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes gleamed with benevolence.
The prescription, he said, tapping the glass,
was in here.</p>

<p>Do you mean to say I’ve drunk it? she screamed.
But it wasn’t for me; it was for my little brother!
And she swept from the drug store.</p>

<p>It’s too bad, sighed the young man, and she
was one of our best customers!</p>

<p>But she isn’t any more. Daily the soda fountain
young man watches her enter the drug store across
the way, where they look before they leap.</p>

<p>An employer, noted for his energy and lack of
tolerance for loafing in any form, visited his stock
room and found a boy leaning idly against a packing
case, whistling cheerily, and with nothing at all on his
mind. The chief stopped and stared. Such a thing
was unheard of in his establishment.</p>

<p>How much are you getting a week? he demanded,
with characteristic abruptness.</p>

<p>Twelve dollars.</p>

<p>Here’s your twelve. Now get out. You’re

<p>As the boy philosophically pocketed the money
and departed, the boss turned to the chief clerk and

<p>Henry was at college. He had been spending
somewhat too freely, and he was short. It was near
the holidays and he hated to write home for money.
As a last resort he pawned his dress suit to tide him

<p>When the time came to leave for home the suit
was still unredeemed. He knew he would need it
at home. He hurriedly redeemed it at the last
moment, packed it in the grip and was off.</p>

<p>His mother was helping him unpack. She came
to the coat.</p>

<p>Henry, she asked, what is this ticket on your
coat for?</p>

<p>Why, mother, he replied, I went to a dance the

<p>She continued putting away his garments. Finally
she lifted out the trousers. They, too, were ticketed.</p>

<p>Some time ago there lived a gentleman of indolent
habits who spent his time visiting among his friends.
After wearing out his welcome in his own neighborhood
he thought he would visit an old Quaker friend
some twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>On his arrival he was cordially received by the
Quaker, who, thinking the visitor had taken much
pains to come so far to see him, treated him with a
great deal of attention and politeness for several days.</p>

<p>As the visitor showed no signs of leaving, the
Quaker became uneasy, but bore it with patience
until the eighth day, when he said to him—</p>

<p>My friend, I am afraid thee will never come again.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I shall, said the visitor. I have enjoyed
my visit very much, and shall certainly come again.</p>

<p>But, said the Quaker, if thee will never leave,
how can thee come again?</p>

<p>Prof. Starr, the famous ethnologist, was in his
humorous and whimsical way accusing women of
barbarism.</p>

<p>And she is not only barbarous—she is illogical
and inconsistent, he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I was walking in the country one day with a
young woman. In a grove we came upon a boy
about to shin up a tree. There was a nest in the
tree, and from a certain angle it was possible to see
in it three eggs.</p>

<p>You wicked little boy, said my companion, are
you going up there to rob that nest?</p>

<p>I am, replied the boy, coolly.</p>

<p>That Confederate money was never taken seriously
is well illustrated in the following story told
by the late General John B. Gordon, and which, as

<p>One day during a temporary cessation of hostilities
between the opposing forces a tall, strapping
Yankee rode into the Confederate camp on a sorry
looking old horse to effect a trade for some tobacco.</p>

<p>Hullo, Yank! hailed one of a number of Confederate
soldiers lolling about on the grass in front of a
tent, that’s a right smart horse you all got there.</p>

<p>Think so? returned the Yank.</p>

<p>Yes; what’ll you take for him?</p>

<p>Oh, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Well, I’ll give you $7,000 for him, bantered the
Confederate.</p>

<p>You go to blazes! indignantly returned the Yank;
I’ve just paid $10,000 of your money to have him
curried.</p>

<p>A party of traveling men in a Chicago hotel

<p>Mayor’s secretary, William P. Ryan, was commenting
on the way in which many illiterate persons
seem to get along in the world, says the Chicago Journal.</p>

<p>The late William J. Carrol used to tell a good story
along this line, said Mr. Ryan. He had business
connected with the collection of rents which used to
take him to a certain place on the eastern shore at
intervals. On one occasion he went into a store
there, the proprietor of which could neither read nor
write. While he was there a man came in who was
evidently a regular customer.</p>

<p>I owe you money, don’t I? he said to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>The latter went to the door and turned it around
so that the back was visible.</p>

<p>That’s so, he replied—you owe me for a cheese.</p>

<p>A cheese? replied the customer. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>The storekeeper looked at the door again.</p>

<p>That’s so, he said, it’s a grindstone; I didn’t see
the dot in the middle.</p>

<p>He had been out late. When he reached his
residence the church clock was chiming 5. Heavy,
weary, disgusted, he opened the front door with some
difficulty, and softly toiled up the stairs, entering
his bedchamber with elaborate caution.</p>

<p>Thank goodness, she was asleep!</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair, and without taking off
his coat or hat, began to remove his shoes. One he
placed with great care upon the floor, but alas! as
he took off the other it slipped out of his hand and
fell with a loud noise.</p>

<p>Wifey awoke on the instant.</p>

<p>Why, George, what are you getting up so early

<p>Not a few people lose their wits in the midst of a

River pilot, as told in St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>Boys, said the great humorist to a group of his
friends—I had great presence of mind once. It was
at a fire. An old man leaned out of a four-story
building calling for help. Everybody in the crowd
below looked up, but nobody did anything. The
ladders weren’t long enough. Nobody had any
presence of mind—nobody but me. I came to the
rescue. I yelled for a rope. When it came I threw
the old man the end of it. He caught it, and I told
him to tie it around his waist. He did so, and I
pulled him down!</p>

<p>The husband arrived home much later than usual
from the office. He took off his boots and stole into
the bedroom. His wife began to stir. Quickly the
panic-stricken man went to the cradle of his firstborn
and began to rock it vigorously.</p>

<p>What are you doing there, Robert? queried his wife.</p>

<p>I’ve been sitting here for nearly two hours trying
to get this baby to sleep, he growled.</p>

<p>Why, Robert, I’ve got him here in bed with me,

<p>Absalom Foote, an eccentric old man, who had
grown tired of life in the city, decided to move to
some smaller town, free from the roar of traffic, the
bustle and confusion of the thronging multitude,
where he could end his days tranquilly, as became a
man of his age. In casting about for a location,
his eyes chanced to light upon the advertisement in
a village paper of one Thomas R. Foote, who wanted
to dispose of his boot and shoe store at a bargain,
having made up his mind to remove to the city.</p>

<p>That’s the very thing, he said, selling shoes is a
very nice, easy occupation. It will give me just
enough to do to keep me from stagnating, and it
won’t wear me out with overwork. I’ll investigate
it. It’s queer, though, that his name is Foote, my
name is Foote, he wants to come to the city, and I
want to go to the country.</p>

<p>A visit to the little town decided him. He liked
its appearance and location. He was pleased, moreover,
with Foote’s shoe store, and bought it good
will and all, at a bargain.</p>

<p>Well, said the other Mr. Foote, you won’t have
to change the sign.</p>

<p>No, he answered slowly, I’ll just add a little to it.</p>

<p>The next day he added this, just below the sign—</p>

<p>This place has changed feet.</p>

<p>Speaking of cold storage eggs, a correspondent
sends in a story that may be new to some readers;
at any rate it sounds plausible. A middle-aged
bachelor was in a restaurant at breakfast, when he
noticed this inscription on the egg—</p>

<p>To Whom it May Concern—Should this meet the
eye of some young man who desires to marry a
farmer’s daughter, 18 years of age, kindly communicate
with ⸺, Sparta, N. J.</p>

<p>After reading this, he made haste to write to the
girl, offering marriage, and in a few days received
this note—</p>

<p>Too late. I am married now and have four
children.</p>

<p>Mr. Ananias came home one night and was received
very icily by his wife. He immediately
assumed the defensive. It was not until after dinner
that he dared ask his wife what the trouble was.
Trouble, said she, why when I sent your suit to the
tailor this morning I found this memorandum in your
pocket, “Gwendolyn, Lenox 1020.”</p>

<p>Why, said Ananias, of course you know what
that means. That is a racing tip. Gwendolyn is a
horse, Lenox a jockey, and 1020 the racing odds. I
am going to the races tomorrow and will play Gwendolyn
at one to two.</p>

<p>The wife admitted her suspicions and begged
forgiveness for doubting the fidelity of her beloved
for one moment.</p>

<p>The next night Ananias came home very late
from the races. Are you asleep, he whispered to his
wife who was in bed with her face to the wall. No,
she answered in distinct and hissing tones. You had
better call up Lenox 1020, your horse wants to speak
to you.</p>

<p>Two men were waiting for a train and one said—I
will ask you a question, and if I can not answer my
own question, I will buy the tickets. Then you ask
a question, and if you can not answer your own, you
buy the tickets. The other agreed to this. Well,
the first man said, you see those rabbit-holes? How
do they dig those holes without leaving any dirt
around them? The other confessed—I don’t know.
That’s your question, so answer it yourself. The
first man winked and replied—They begin at the
bottom and dig up! But, said the second man, how
do they get at the bottom to begin? That’s your
question, was the first man’s rejoinder. Answer it
yourself. The other man bought the tickets.</p>

<p>Here is an incident that a Chanute man tells as
having occurred in a certain Kansas town. He was
in the ticket office and watched the proceedings.</p>

<p>A man came up to the window and asked for a
ticket to Kansas City, inquiring the price.</p>

<p>Two twenty-five, said the agent.</p>

<p>The man dug down into a well-worn pocketbook
and fished out a bill. It was a banknote for $2.
It was also all the money he had.</p>

<p>How soon does this train go? he inquired.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, replied the agent.</p>

<p>The man hurried away. Soon he was back with
three silver dollars, with which he bought a ticket.</p>

<p>Pardon my curiosity, said the ticket seller, but
how did you get that money? It isn’t a loan, for I
see you have disposed of the $2 bill.</p>

<p>That’s all right, said the man. No, I didn’t
borrow. I went to a pawnshop and soaked the bill
for $1.50. Then as I started back here I met an old
acquaintance, to whom I sold the pawn for $1.50.
I then had $3, and he has the pawn ticket for which
the $2 bill stands as security.</p>

<p>An aged Jersey farmer, visiting a circus for the

popping and mouth agape at the strange beast
within. The circus proper began and the crowds

before the cage in stunned silence, appraising every
detail of the misshapen legs, the cloven hoofs, the
pendulous upper lip, and the curiously moulded back
of the sleepy-eyed beast. Fifteen minutes passed.
Then the farmer turned away and spat disgustedly.</p>

<p>A writer says in regard to the Prussia of fifty
years ago that it had a state lottery, and in every
town, large or small, was a collector appointed to
sell tickets. One day a servant-girl came to the
collector in Hagen and asked if she could buy
No. 23.</p>

<p>He did not have it in his possession, but as the girl
seemed very much in earnest, and refused to be put
off with any other number, he tried to obtain it
from some of the other collectors in town, and
finally succeeded.</p>

<p>The drawing took place, and Hagen rose to a
state of feverish excitement when it was known that
this girl had become a winner of a large sum of
money. She found herself for a time the chief
object of interest in the town.</p>

<p>She was, of course, asked how she came to fix
upon No. 23. Thereupon she gave this simple and
lucid explanation:</p>

<p>I dreamed one night No. 7, and the second night
I dreamed No. 7, and a third night again. So I
thought, Three times seven makes twenty-three,
and I bought that number.</p>

<p>The editor of the “Hardeman Free Press” says:</p>

<p>We fell asleep in a chair at Grand Junction last
Wednesday night on our way home from Memphis
in our usual soaked condition and let our train leave
us. The hotel clerk told us to go upstairs and take
the room on the right side of the hall with the lamp
burning low. He sed he was crowded and we would
have to double up with a man. We went up and
pulled off our things and went to bed without waking
our bedfellow, who was sleeping sound with the sheet
over his head to keep off the muskeeters. Before
we fell into the arms of morphine we seen a young
lady and a young gent come in and set down by the
winder. At first they talked so low we could not
hear what they sed. Finally we heard the little
miss say: Wallie, ain’t you ashamed to try to kiss
me right here where we air setting up with a dead
person? We felt cureous. We slowly reached over
and touched the nose of the man we wus in bed with,
and seen at a glance that he was dead alright. We
riz up instantly, and it was a race to a finish twixt
us three fer the bottom of the steps. It is useless
to say we was furst past the post by two lengths.
We didn’t skeer that couple any wuse than the corpse
skeered us. We walked through the country to

on Fourth street, I saw an unusually amazing incident.
A lady of stupendous dimensions, stylishly attired,
entered the store and seated herself to be waited

her. After rejecting this pair and that, she decided
on some brown oxfords. The clerk knelt down to
lace them, and she gazed about the room. Suddenly
she looked down and saw the bald head. Thinking
that it was her roller-topped knee, she modestly
drew her skirt over it.</p>

<p>Colonel Phil Thompson tells of the trials experienced
by a friend of his who recently acquired a
new stenographer. The dear little thing is a trifle

she tries so hard to please. He is too big-hearted
to discharge the girl, for she needs the money; so
he corrects the spelling.</p>

<p>Recently, however, he was forced to call her

which was “fourty”.</p>

<p>This is the true story of a resourceful motorist.
Of the ethics of it, there is no condoning. A traffic
law in a New England city forbids the parking of
cars on the principal business street. A citizen
who understood this, was sure he could stop his
car, deliver a message and be back in his seat all
in a moment. But he was detained. Also he forgot.
When he came out a policeman stood by his
automobile. Did the man go to his car? He did
not. He hurried to his office: He telephoned to
police headquarters: My car (giving a detailed
description) has been stolen. In a half hour this
reply: An officer has found your car. It is here
at headquarters. Come and get it. He did. Profuse
thanks. Was it clever?</p>

ranger of the Pasadena district and read recently at
the annual dinner of the Sierra Club in Los Angeles.
Kind and Respected Cir—</p>

<p>I see in the paper that a man named J⸺
S⸺ was atacted and et up by a bare whose
cubs he was trying to git when the she bare came up
and stopt him by eatin him up in the mountains
near your town. What i want to know is did it kill
him or was he only partly et up am he from this
place and all about the bare. I don’t know but
what he is a distant husband of mine. My first
husband was of that name and I supposed he was
killed in the war but the name of the man the bare
et being the same i thought it might be him after
all and i thought to know if he wasn’t killed either
in the war or by the bare for i have been married
twice since and their ought to be divorce papers got
out by him or me if the bare did not eat him all up.
If it is him you will know it by him having six toes
on the left foot. He also sings base and has a spread
eagle tattoed on his front chest and a ankor on his
right arm which you will know him if the bare did
not eat up these parts of him. If alive don’t tell
him I am married to J⸺ W⸺ for he
never liked J⸺. Mebbe you had better let
on as if i am ded but find out all you can about him
without him knowing anything what it is for. That
is if the bare did not eat him all up. If it did i don’t
see you can do anything and you needn’t take any
trouble. My respeks to your family and please
ancer back.</p>

<p>P. S.—Was the bare killed. Also was he married
again and did he leave any property worth me laying
claim to?</p>

<p>An advertisement in a newspaper calling for a
“first-class bookkeeper at $3 a week” drew forth the
following answer, the only one attracted by the
munificent salary.</p>

<p>I am a young man, thirty-seven years of age,
having had a business experience of twenty-three
years, being connected with the United States Embassy
at Madagascar, and feel confident if you will
give me a trial I can prove my worth to you. I am
not only an expert bookkeeper, proficient stenographer
and typewriter, excellent operator and erudite college
graduate, but have several other accomplishments
which might make me desirable. I am an experienced
snow shoveler, a first-class peanut roaster,
have some knowledge of removing superfluous hair
and clipping puppy dogs’ ears, have a medal for
reciting “Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight.” Am a
skilled chiropodist and practical farmer, can also
cook, take care of horses, crease trousers, open
oysters and repair umbrellas. Being possessed of
great physical beauty, I would not only be useful, but
would be ornamental as well, lending to the sacred
precincts of your office that delightful artistic charm
that a Satsuma vase or stuffed billy-goat would.
As to salary, I would feel I was robbing the widow
and swiping the sponge cake from the orphan if I
was to take advantage of your munificence by accepting
the too fabulous sum of $3 per week, and I
would be entirely willing to give you my services for
less, and by accepting $1.37 per week would give
you an opportunity of not only increasing your
donation to the church, pay your butcher and keep
up your life insurance, but also to found a home for
indigent fly-paper salesmen and endow a free bed
in the cat home.</p>

<p>Private John Allen takes a deep interest in the
advertising business. Advertisements that he deems
exceptionally good he clips out and pastes in a scrap-book.
As he was showing this scrap-book to a guest
one day, he said:</p>

<p>But the best ad I know of is not in here. For
it wasn’t written, but spoken. It earned its originator
some thousands of dollars, yet I can never
show it. I can only describe it, and description
fails to do it justice.</p>

<p>It was the work of a clothier in Nashville. He
had, with his partner, the first establishment in
town, and the business of the firm was considered
very prosperous. The two men had married sisters,
and their relationship was more than friendly.
Hence the greatest surprise overtook Nashville
when the junior partner suddenly took out a summons
and hauled his senior into court.</p>

<p>The senior partner is ruining the business, gossip
said. He is getting softening of the brain, or paresis,
or something of that sort. Now is the height of
the spring season, when they ought to be making
money hand over fist, but the senior’s cracked
methods are spoiling everything.</p>

<p>So all Nashville took a tremendous interest in
the case, and on the morning it was called, the
courtroom was crowded as in a murder trial.</p>

<p>The junior partner’s complaint was presented
strongly and directly. He showed that goods were
being sacrificed at a fraction of their value, and he
asked that this ruinous trading be stopped, lest
ruin ensue.</p>

<p>The defendant’s lawyer, an able fellow, secured
an adjournment for three weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>On the announcement of this adjournment, the
junior partner gave a loud groan. He leaped to
his feet, and rushed out like one demented, shouting
as he went:</p>

<p>Merciful heavens, then the sacrifice must still
go on!</p>

<p>I don’t need to tell you how much business that
firm did in the next three weeks.</p>

<p>Man, born of woman, is of a few days and no
teeth. And, indeed, it would be money in his pocket
sometimes if he had less of either. As for his days, he
wasteth one-third of them, and as for his teeth, he
has convulsions when he cuts them, and as the last
one comes through, lo, the dentist is twisting the
first one out, and the last end of that man’s jaw is
worse than the first, being full of porcelain and a
roof-plate built to hold blackberry seeds.</p>

<p>Stone bruises line his pathway to manhood; his
father boxes his ears at home, the big boys cuff him
in the play ground, and the teacher whips him in the
school-room. He buyeth Northwestern at 110, when
he hath sold short at 96, and his neighbor unloadeth
upon him Iron Mountain at 65⅝, and it straightway
breaketh down to 52¼. He riseth early and sitteth
up late that he may fill his barns and store-houses,
and lo! his children’s lawyers divide the spoil among
themselves and say, Ha, ha! He growleth and is sore
distressed because it raineth, and he beateth upon
his breast and sayeth, My crop is lost! because it
raineth not. The late rains blight his wheat and
the frost biteth his peaches. If it be so that the
sun shineth, even among the nineties, he sayeth,
Woe is me, for I perish, and if the northwest wind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
sigheth down in forty-two below he crieth, would
that I were dead! If he wear sackcloth and blue
jeans men say he is a tramp, and if he goeth forth
shaven and clad in purple and fine linen all the people
cry, shoot the dude!</p>

<p>He carrieth insurance for twenty-five years, until
he hath paid thrice over for all his goods, and then
he letteth his policy lapse one day, and that same
night fire destroyeth his store. He buildeth him a
house in Jersey, and his first born is devoured by
mosquitoes; he pitcheth his tent in New York, and
tramps devour his substance. He moveth to Kansas,
and a cyclone carrieth his house away over into
Missouri, while a prairie fire and ten million acres
of grasshoppers fight for his crop. He settleth himself
in Kentucky, and is shot the next day by a
gentleman, a colonel and a statesman, because, sah,
he resembles, sah, a man, sah, he did not like, sah.
Verily, there is no rest for the sole of his feet, and if

<p>Teacher—Who can make a sentence with gruesome

<p>Ikey—The man stopped shaving and grew some
whiskers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Visitor—How’s your brother, Tommy?</p>

<p>Tommy—He’s in bed; he hurt himself.</p>

<p>Visitor—How did he do it?</p>

<p>Tommy—We were playing who could lean furthest

<p>A lad sat on the floor playing. Suddenly he set
up a howl.</p>

<p>Henry, what is the matter? asked the mother.</p>

<p>The cat scratched me.</p>

<p>Why, the cat is not here. When did she scratch
you?</p>

<p>What makes a horse act naughty when he sees
an auto?</p>

<p>It is this way—Horses is used to seein’ other
horses pull wagons, and they don’t know what to
think of ’em goin’ along without a horse. Guess if
you saw a pair of pants walkin’ down the street
without a man in ’em you’d be scared, too.</p>

<p>The passionate rhythms of “The Merry Widow”
waltz floated through the office, and the boss looked
up from his desk impatiently.</p>

<p>Frederic, he said, I wish you wouldn’t whistle at

I’m only just whistlin’.</p>

<p>After a teacher had recited “The Landing of the
Pilgrims,” she requested each pupil to try to draw
from his or her imagination, a picture of Plymouth
Rock.</p>

<p>Most of them went to work at once, but one little
fellow hesitated, and at length raised his hand.</p>

<p>Well, Willie, what is it? asked the teacher.</p>

<p>Please, ma’am, do you want us to draw a hen or
a rooster?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is Jimmie’s essay on pants: Pants are made
for men and not for women. Women are made for
men and not for pants. When a man pants for a
woman and a woman pants for a man they are a
pair of pants. Such pants don’t last. Pants are
like molasses—they are thinner in hot weather and
thicker in cold. Men are often mistaken in pants;
such mistakes are breaches of promise. There has
been much discussion whether pants is singular or
plural. Seems to me when men wear pants it is
plural, and when they don’t wear pants it is singular.
Men go on a tear in their pants and it is all
right, but when the pants go on a tear it is all wrong.
If you want to make pants last, make the coat first.</p>

<p>Pop, I got in trouble at school today and it’s all

<p>The pupils of a certain school were asked to write
original compositions on “kings.” The prize was
carried off by the youth who handed in the following:</p>

<p>The most powerful king on earth, is Wor-king;
the laziest, Shir-king; one of the worst kings, Smo-king;
the wittiest, Jo-king; the quietest, Thin-king;
the thirstiest, Drin-king; the slyest, Win-king; the
noisiest, Tal-king.</p>

<p>At a public school the children were training for
the annual flag day celebration. One boy, in order
to show good reason why he should take a prominent
part in the ceremonies, said that he had a real gun;
another had a pistol; a small girl had a flag, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, one tow-haired lad of six came up to the
teacher, and stood waiting for her to see him.</p>

<p>Well, what is it? she asked.</p>

<p>I has a union suit, he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now in order to subtract, explained a teacher to
the class in mathematics, things always have to be
of the same denomination. For instance, we couldn’t
take three apples from four years, nor six horses
from nine dogs.</p>

<p>A hand went up in the back of the room.</p>

<p>Well, Johnny? smiled the unsuspecting teacher.</p>

<p>Please, ma’am! shouted the boy, can’t you take
four quarts of milk from three cows?</p>

<p>Little Elizabeth and her mother were having

<p>These little sardines, Elizabeth, are sometimes

then asked—</p>

<p>But, mother, how do the large fish get the cans open?</p>

<p>A teacher had been telling her class of boys
recently that worms had become so numerous that
they destroyed the crops, and it was necessary to
import the sparrow to exterminate them. The sparrows
multiplied very fast and were gradually driving
away our native birds.</p>

<p>Johnny was apparently very inattentive, and the
teacher, thinking to catch him napping, said—</p>

<p>Johnny, which is worse, to have worms or sparrows?</p>

<p>Johnny hesitated a moment and then replied:
Please, I never had the sparrows.</p>

<p>George, George, mind; your hat will be blown off
if you lean so far out of the window! exclaimed a
fond father to his little son, who was traveling with
him in a railway carriage. Quickly snatching the
hat from the head of the refractory youngster, papa
hid it behind his back.</p>

<p>There, now, the hat has gone! he cried, pretending
to be angry. And George immediately set up a
howl. After a time the father remarked—</p>

<p>Come, be quiet; if I whistle your hat will come
back again.</p>

<p>Then he whistled and replaced the hat on the
boy’s head. There, it’s back again, you see. Afterward,
while papa was talking to mamma, a small,
shrill voice was heard saying—</p>

<p>Papa, papa, I’ve thrown my hat out of the
window! Whistle again, will you?</p>

<p>The bank teller in a snippy way said: But I don’t
know you, madam!</p>

<p>The woman was red-headed, and she got red-headed
in a minute. She said: Oh, yes, you do.
I don’t need anyone to identify me. I’m the red-headed
hen next door to you whose “imps of boys”
are always running across your garden. When you
started to town this morning your wife said: Now,
Henry, if you want a dinner fit to eat this evening,
you’ll have to leave me a little money. I can’t keep
this house on Christian Science.</p>

<p>Here is your money, interrupted the paying teller
very faintly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In order that his wife might become better
acquainted with business methods, Mr. Ferguson
handed $100 to her, and instructed her to deposit it
in bank in her own name and pay her bills thereafter
with checks.</p>

<p>Several weeks afterward she came to him in a
high state of indignation.</p>

<p>George, she said, the other day those people down
at the bank wrote me a note and told me I had overdrawn
my account—whatever that is—and that I
would have to send them $4.75 to balance it. I sent
it to them right away, but it didn’t satisfy them.
They’re bothering me about it again.</p>

<p>You sent the $4.75?</p>

<p>Yes. Same day.</p>

<p>Well, that’s—by the way, Laura, how did you
send it?</p>

<p>I sent them a check for it, of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some few days ago a Louisville banker was
approached by an impecunious farmer for a loan.
Now at times this banker is deaf for commercial purposes.
The farmer was chronically wanting to borrow,
and his security was getting shaky. I’d like to
borrow five thousand, pleaded the farmer. The
banker cupped his hand to his ear and said: Speak
a little louder and cut down the amount.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thousands of girls are sent out into the world
with what is called finished educations, who cannot
even give a proper receipt for money, to say nothing
of drawing a promissory note, a draft or a bill, or
understanding the significance and importance of
business contracts.</p>

<p>Such a woman presented a check for payment to
the paying teller of her bank. He passed it back to
her with the request that she be kind enough to indorse
it. The lady wrote on the back of the check,
I have done business with this bank for many years,
and I believe it to be all right. Mrs. James B. Brown.</p>

<p>Another society woman in New York presented a
check for payment at the bank, and the teller told
her that it was not signed. Oh, do they have to be
signed? she replied. What an awful lot of red tape
there is about a banking business.</p>

<p>I know of a lady whose husband made a deposit
for her in a bank and gave her a check book so that
she could pay her bills without annoying him. One
day she received a notice from the bank that her
account was overdrawn. She went to the bank and
told the teller that there must be some mistake about
it, because she still had a lot of checks left in her book.
She knew so little about business that she thought
she could keep drawing any amount until the checks
were all gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Among the more recent stories of feminine banking
is one of a young lady who in a fit of abstraction
signed a check, Your loving Susie. A still later anecdote
is this, from one of our exchanges:</p>

<p>A fund was being raised in New York for the
benefit of sufferers by a great disaster, and a certain
rich but illiterate woman was approached upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Oh, I shouldn’t mind sending the money, she said,
but I do hate to have my name in all the papers.</p>

<p>But that could be easily arranged, said the gentleman
who had opened the subject.</p>

<p>Why, yes, of course, remarked the woman, I
could send an anonymous check. Why didn’t I think
of that before?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four or five ladies bustled into a private office
the other day.</p>

<p>What can I do for you, ladies? asked the banker
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Why, began one of the visitors, we are taking up
a subscription and we knew you wouldn’t like it if we
didn’t give you an opportunity to subscribe.</p>

<p>The banker bowed graciously and asked: And
the object? Of course it is a worthy one, or you would
not be interested in it.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, replied the spokeswoman, we think it a
very worthy object. It is to build a home for aged
and indigent widows.</p>

<p>Excellent! Excellent! I shall take pleasure in
making you out a check.</p>

<p>Oh, how lovely of you! exclaimed the spokeswoman
when she received the bit of paper and read
the amount—one hundred pounds. Oh, we didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
expect to get that much from you. We are ever so
much obliged.</p>

<p>So good of him! and similar exclamations were
heard as the check was passed around for the admiration
of the party.</p>

<p>But, said the lady who handled the check last,
you haven’t signed it.</p>

<p>That is because I do not wish my benefactions
known to the world, said the banker modestly. I
wish to give the check anonymously. And he bowed
the ladies out with great dignity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a banking office in New Orleans is an aged
bookkeeper who began his connection with the business
the day it was established. As the years went
by, the proprietor, who had started with little, but
was extremely close, amassed an enormous fortune.
The bookkeeper piled up but a small amount of savings.</p>

<p>At last the twenty-fifth anniversary of the firm
and of the bookkeeper’s services came along. He
remembered it, but thought no one else would. To
his surprise, the proprietor spoke of it at once.</p>

<p>Williams, he said, do you know what day this is?</p>

<p>Our twenty-fifth anniversary, sir.</p>

<p>It is indeed, Williams. And now I have thought
to commemorate the event, and I have put in this
envelope for you a small gift to express my appreciation
of your faithful service.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper, his hopes raised high, took the
envelope from his employer and opened it. The
token was a photograph of the employer.</p>

<p>Well? demanded the donor, as the other hesitated.
What do you want to say about it?</p>

<p>It’s just like you! murmured the bookkeeper.
It’s just like you.</p>

<p>Aren’t you pretty young to be a practicing
physician? asked the severe-looking female person
sternly.</p>

<p>Well, you see, I only doctor children, said the
young medico, nervously.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Doctor, are you sure my husband has pneumonia?
I have heard of doctors treating patients for pneumonia
who finally died of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Well, madam, I don’t make such blunders.
If I treat a patient for pneumonia, he dies of pneumonia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Patient—Doctor, it hurts me to breathe. In
fact, the only trouble now seems to be with my
breath.</p>

<p>Physician—All right. I’ll give you something
that will soon stop that.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young doctor in a country district was called
one night by an old farmer to his first case. The patient
was the farmer’s son, who was lying on the bed
in much pain. The young medico threw out his chest
and said: This should cause you no alarm. It is
nothing but a corrustified exegesis antispasmodically
emanating from the physical refrigerator, producing
a prolific source of irritability in the pericranial
epidermis.</p>

<p>The farmer looked at him and replied, just what
I said, but his mother thought it was the stomachache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wife—Now dear, here’s the doctor to see you.</p>

<p>Merchant Prince—Send him away and fetch
the undertaker! You know I never deal with
middlemen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A doctor came up to a patient in an insane asylum,
slapped him on the back and said: Well, old man,
you’re all right. You can run along and write
your folks that you’ll be back home in two weeks
as good as new.</p>

<p>The patient went off gayly to write his letter. He
had it finished and sealed, but when he was licking
the stamp it slipped through his fingers to the floor
lighted on the back of a cockroach that was passing
and stuck. The patient hadn’t seen the cockroach.
What he did see was his escaped postage stamp
zigzagging aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard,
wavering up over the baseboard and following
a crooked track up the wall and across the ceiling.
In depressed silence he tore up the letter that he
had just written and dropped the pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>Two weeks! Hell! he said. I won’t be out of
here in three years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had just hung out his shingle. That morning
a stranger entered. The doctor asked to be
excused as he hurried to the phone.</p>

<p>Taking down the receiver, he said: Yes, this
is Dr. Whoosit. Yes, will be ready for you at two-ten
this afternoon. But please be prompt, for I am
very busy. Two hundred dollars? Yes, that was
the estimate I gave you.</p>

<p>Hanging up the receiver, he turned to the stranger
and rubbing his hands asked: Now, sir, what can
I do for you?</p>

<p>Nothing, replied the stranger quietly. I only
came in to connect up the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following item is taken from a county officer’s
health report: The patient died of blood poison
from a broken ankle contracted in an automobile
accident, which was a very strange occurrence,
since he was struck between the lamp post and the
radiator.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herr Doctor, my wife and I are possessed! Can’t
you cure us? What sort of a demon is it possesses
you? Peasant: The fighting demon; it forces us
to come to blows, and we are both sorry for it afterward.
Doctor (making three times the sign of the
cross): Begone, foul demon of discord, begone!
So that was only the preliminary cure, now I will
write a prescription for you. When the fit comes
on again, the one who is not yet begun to scold and
fight is to take the medicine bottle and a spoon and
go out of the room, while the other remains inside.
After ten minutes the first one is to come in again,
count twenty-seven drops into the spoon, and give
them to the other; then the latter is to take the
spoon and count twenty-seven drops and give them
to the first one, after which you shake hands together.
Not a word to be spoken the whole time. Three
months later the peasant came again with his wife:
Herr Doctor, we have come to make you a present
of this ham for having cured us so thoroughly! This
is a true story, and occurred in Holstein.</p>

<p>A prominent lawyer of New York says that many

stood a good chance of starving, he decided to come
East again. Without any money he boarded a train
for Nashville, Tenn., intending to seek employment
as reporter on one of the daily newspapers, says the

his ticket, he said—</p>

<p>I am on the staff of the ⸺ of Nashville. I

<p>Oh, yes, I recognize him as one of the staff; it is
all right.</p>

the editor.</p>

<p>Harry Bulger has recently added to his repertoire
of stories a new character vignette which has been
received with laughter in the South. As Mr. Bulger
will be the guest of the Forty Club in Chicago during
the “Woodland” engagement in that city, he is
reserving this story for the post-prandial gossip.</p>

<p>It relates largely to a lawyer and a Jewish client
during a civil action. The attorney, watching the
evidence and the countenance of the Judge, whose
reputation for severity was well known in the district,
whispered to his Hebrew client.</p>

<p>It looks very bad. We are going to lose the case.
Whereupon the client responded.</p>

<p>Vell, I will send the Judge a box of cigars.</p>

<p>Great heavens, no! That would end it.</p>

<p>The following day much to the surprise of the
plaintiff’s attorney, the decision was rendered for his
client. Meeting his Jewish friend later the lawyer
exclaimed—</p>

<p>By Jove, I cannot understand this decision. Beats

Judge a box of cigars?</p>

<p>The blessed man that preached for us last Sunday,
said Mr. Partington, served the Lord for thirty
years—first as a circus rider, and then as a locust-preacher,
and last as an exhauster.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Patience—Is your preacher sensational?</p>

<p>Patrice—I should say so! Why, he preached
a sermon last Sunday and he took for his subject,
It’s hard to keep a good man down. Well? Oh, it
was all about Jonah and the whale.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A series of revival services were being held
recently in a Missouri city, and placards giving
notice of the services were posted in conspicuous
places. One day the following notice was posted:</p>

<p>Hell, Its Location and Absolute Certainty.
Thomas Jones, barytone soloist, will sing, Tell
Mother I’ll Be There.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was once a clergyman’s son, who was
educated for the ministry. He finished his theological
course at Oxford and returned home with
the Oxford accent. On the following Sunday he
was invited to fill his father’s pulpit for the morning
service. The young preacher announced his text
as follows: And they wequiahed of him Bawabbas.
Now Bawabbas was a wobbah. At the evening
service the old man resumed his pulpit and preached
an eloquent sermon from the text, O Lord, have
mercy upon us, for this my son is lunatic and we
are sore distressed.</p>

<p>When was the automobile first mentioned in
the Bible?</p>

<p>When Elijah crossed the river Jordan by a Ford
and went up on high.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Clergyman—examining a Sunday School, Now,
can any of you tell me what are the sins of omission?</p>

<p>Small Scholar—Yes, sir, they’re the sins you
ought to have committed, and haven’t.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rev. Goodman—Mr. Slick, our Sunday-school
superintendent is a tried and trusted employe of
yours, is he not?</p>

<p>Banker—He was trusted, and he’ll be tried if we’re
only fortunate enough to catch him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is reported that Pope Gregory XVI offered
his snuff-box to a Cardinal, who declined it, saying:
No, your holiness, I have not that vice. To which
the Pope replied in thoroughly human way, if it
had been a vice you would have had it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mama, said little Elsie, do men ever go to heaven?</p>

<p>Why of course, my dear. What makes you ask?</p>

<p>Because I never see any pictures of angels with
whiskers.</p>

<p>Well, said the mother, thoughtfully, some men
do go to heaven, but they get there by a close shave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Bishop, addressing the little folks at the
children’s service, became impressive. Only think,
children, he said, in Africa, there are 10,000,000
square miles of territory without a single Sunday
school where little girls and boys can spend their
Sunday afternoons. Now, what should we all try
to save up our money for?</p>

<p>The children (unanimously)—To go to Africa.</p>

<p>At a sewing circle all the women were talking,
and some of the subjects got hopelessly confused. For
instance, the subject of crickets and church choirs.
I never heard such a horrid noise as they made last
Sunday, said one woman, referring to the choir. Nor
I, said another, thinking she referred to the fall crickets.
They say they make that noise with their hind legs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An evangelist who was conducting nightly services
announced that on the following evening he
would speak on the subject of Liars. He advised
his hearers to read in advance the seventeenth
chapter of Mark.</p>

<p>The next night he arose and said: I am going
to preach on Liars tonight, and I would like to know
how many read the chapter I suggested. A hundred
hands were upraised.</p>

<p>Now, he said, you are the very persons I want to
talk to—there isn’t any seventeenth chapter of
Mark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Baltimore man tells us of attending a church
on one occasion when the minister delivered a sermon
of but ten minutes’ duration—a most unusual thing
for him.</p>

<p>Upon the conclusion of his remarks the minister
had added: I regret to inform you, brethren that my
dog, who appears to be particularly fond of paper,
this morning ate that portion of my sermon that I
have not delivered.</p>

<p>After the service, the clergyman was met at the
door by a man who, as a rule, attended divine service
in another parish. Shaking the good man by the
hand, he said:</p>

<p>Doctor, I should like to know whether that dog of
yours has pups. If so, I want to get one to give to
my minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A clergyman preached a rather long sermon from
the text, Thou art weighed in the balance and found
wanting. After the congregation had listened about
an hour, some began to get weary and went out;
others soon followed, greatly to the annoyance of the
minister. Another person started, whereupon the
preacher stopped his sermon and said: That is right
gentlemen; as fast as you are weighed, pass out! He
continued his sermon some time after that, but no
one disturbed him by leaving.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not a few preachers would be glad to be the
victims of such a practical joke as was recently played
upon the Rev. Mr. Hageman, of Oxford, Mich. At
the annual meeting of the church of which he is pastor
the question of hiring a preacher comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>At the last meeting of this society, when the subject
was brought up, a good deacon arose and said:
All those in favor of retaining Brother Hageman for
another year—at the same salary—will please rise.</p>

<p>Not a person rose, and the minister, who was
present, felt as uncomfortable as possible, and heartily
wished himself anywhere else. Then the good deacon
who had put the question arose again and said, with
a twinkle of the eye:</p>

<p>I see not one favors that motion, so I will put it
again in this way: All those in favor of keeping the
Rev. Mr. Hageman—at an increased salary—will
please rise.</p>

<p>Everyone got upon his feet. Then it dawned upon
Mr. Hageman that he had been the victim of a
joke, and a smile lighted his eye, and the color returned
to his cheeks. Some of his best friends had
planned the surprise, and the little scheme had worked
to perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The deacons and other officers of a church had
met to discuss the best method of getting rid of a
pastor who had worn out his usefulness. After
various methods had been suggested without any of
them seeming feasible, one brother, who was a
good deal of a wag, said:</p>

<p>I tell you what to do. Let’s pay him all his salary
in arrears and raise him to a thousand a year and he
will drop dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain Duluth clergyman was a rather prosy
speaker, but occasionally he proved that he had
ready wit. One evening he was addressing his
congregation on the beauty of leading an upright
life, when he suddenly paused and beckoned to the
sexton. Brown, said he, in a clear, distinct tone of
voice, open a couple of windows on each side of the
church, please. Beg your pardon, sir! exclaimed
the sexton, with a look of great surprise. Did I
understand you to say, open the windows? It is
a very bitter cold night, sir. Yes, I am well aware
of that, Brown, was the cold, hard reply of the clergyman,
as he gazed around the church, but it is not
healthy to sleep with the windows shut! We refrain
from going any deeper into personalities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The late Bishop Beckwith, of Georgia, was fond
of his gun, and spent much of his time hunting, says
Representative Adamson. One day the Bishop was
out with his dog and gun, and met a member of
his parish, whom he reproved for his inattention to
his religious duties. You should attend church
and read your Bible, said Bishop. I do read my
Bible, Bishop, was the answer, and I don’t find any
mention of the Apostles going a-shooting. No,
replied the Bishop, the shooting was very bad in
Palestine, so they went fishing instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>A preacher who went to a Kentucky parish where
the parishioners bred horses was asked to invite the
prayers of the congregation for Lucy Grey. He did
so. They prayed three Sundays for Lucy Grey. On
the fourth he was told he need not do it any more.</p>

<p>Why, said the preacher, is she dead?</p>

<p>No, answered the man, she won the Derby.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. Mr. Spicer had for three days enjoyed
the telephone, which had been his last gift from an
admiring parishioner. He had been using it immediately
before going to church.</p>

<p>When the time came for him to announce the
hymn he rose and with his usual impressive manner
read the words. Then in a crisp, firm tone he said,
Let us all unite in hymn six double o; sing three.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Henry Ward Beecher was spared much embarrassment
by his quickness at repartee is illustrated
by the following story:</p>

<p>One evening as he was in the midst of an impassioned
speech some one attempted to interrupt him
by suddenly crowing like a rooster. It was done to
perfection; a number of people laughed in spite of
themselves, and the speaker’s friends felt that in a
moment the whole effect of the meeting, and of Mr.
Beecher’s thrilling appeals might be lost. The orator,
however, was equal to the occasion. He stopped,
listened till the crowing ceased, and then, with a look
of surprise, pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>Morning already, he said; my watch is only at 10.
But there can be no mistake about it. The instincts
of the lower animals are infallible.</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter. The lower animal
in the gallery collapsed, and Mr. Beecher was able to
resume as if nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>The maid had been using surreptitiously the bathtub
of her employer, an elderly bishop. He was a
bachelor, very fastidious about his toilet, and desired
the exclusive use of his tub.</p>

<p>He reprimanded the maid with much indignation:</p>

<p>What distresses me most, Mary, is that you have
done this behind my back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain minister in a certain flock took permanent
leave of his congregation in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters: I come to say good-bye.
I don’t think God loves this church, because none
of you ever die. I don’t think you love each other,
because I never marry any of you. I don’t think
you love me, because you have not paid my salary.
Your donations are moldy fruit and wormy apples,
and by their fruits ye shall know them. Brothers,
I am going to a better place. I have been called
to be chaplain of a penitentiary. Where I go ye
cannot come, but I go to prepare a place for you, and
may the Lord have mercy on your souls. Good-bye.</p>

<p>Sister Henderson, said Deacon Hypers, you should
avoid even appearance of evil.</p>

<p>Why Deacon, what do you mean? asked Sister
Henderson.</p>

<p>I observe that on your sideboard you have several
cut-glass decanters, and that each of them is half
filled with what appears to be ardent spirits.</p>

<p>Well, now, Deacon, it isn’t anything of the kind.
The bottles look so pretty on the sideboard that I
just filled them half way with some floor stain and
furniture polish, just for appearances.</p>

<p>That’s why I am cautioning you, sister, replied
the Deacon. Feeling a trifle weak and faint, I helped
myself to a dose from the big bottle in the middle.</p>

<p>An archdeacon engaged as new footman a well-recommended
youth who served as stable boy. The
first duty which the youth was called upon to perform
was to accompany the archdeacon on a series
of formal calls.</p>

<p>Bring the cards, Thomas, and leave one at each
house, ordered his master. After two hours of
visiting from house to house the archdeacon’s list
was exhausted. This is the last house, Thomas, he
said; leave two cards here.</p>

<p>Beggin’ yor pardon, sir, was the deferential reply,
I can’t; I’ve only the ace of spades left.</p>

<p>Senator Gore, of Oklahoma, is given credit for
this story, told on his recent visit to a Methodist convention
at St. Joseph. It is related by the Rev.
Mr. Williams, pastor of the Baptist Church of Pleasant
Hill, who happened to hear it.</p>

<p>According to Senator Gore, there was an accomplished
hen with a brood of chickens—five roosters
and five pullets. The chicks matured and went their
various ways, while the mother hen busied herself
with a new brood. In course of time Methodist
ministers came into the vicinity of Chickenville to
hold a conference, and, as might be suspected, the
five young roosters, fat, yellow-legged and extremely
tender, were feasted upon by various and sundry
preachers. The young pullets, left behind, were met
by the mother hen a few days later. My children,
she asked, where are your brothers?</p>

<p>They have entered the ministry.</p>

<p>Bracing herself from the shock of disclosure, a
look of resignation spread over Biddy’s countenance
as she replied:</p>

<p>Well, my dears, perhaps it is all for the best.
They would not have made very good lay members,
anyway.</p>

<p>A Philadelphia clergyman, visiting an old schoolmate
in Montana, was called upon to speak during
revival services in a large camp of Swedish miners.</p>

<p>Looking straight at a powerful looking man
who sat in front of him, the minister asked:</p>

<p>My friend, don’t you want to work for the Lord?</p>

<p>The Swede thought a few seconds and replied
slowly:</p>

<p>No, I tank no, de Norden Pacific fallers is good
enough for me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A short time ago a somewhat laughable incident
took place in a northern church. The minister,
after proclaiming the banns of matrimony between
a young couple, concluded by saying, If there be
any objections, they can now be stated. A fashionable
youth, an old admirer of the intended bride,
noticing the eyes of a portion of the congregation
fixed upon him, rose up and exclaimed, I have
no objection for my own part, to the astonishment
of all about him, and resumed his seat, as if he had
done a mere formal piece of business.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each Sunday the parson rode three miles to
church. On this particular Sunday it was raining
very hard. He rode the distance on horseback
and, when he reached the church, was soaking wet.</p>

<p>Several of the good old sisters who were there
early placed a chair before the fire for him and hung
his wet coat up to dry.</p>

<p>I am so afraid I won’t be dry enough to preach,
he said.</p>

<p>Oh, said one of the sisters, when you get in the
pulpit and start preaching, you will be dry enough.</p>

<p>Whenever a Sunday school teacher comes to
Louisville invariably a good story is in order. Last
night one of them was at a local hotel, and he brought
along his story. Morrison R. Kendrick is his name,
and Chicago is his town. The story is told by Mr.
Kendrick as follows:</p>

<p>Sunday School Superintendent—Who led the children
of Israel into Canaan? Will one of the smaller
boys answer?</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>Superintendent (sternly)—Can no one tell?
You little fellow on that seat next to the aisle, who
led the children of Israel into Canaan?</p>

<p>Little Boy (badly frightened)—It wasn’t me.
I—I just moved here last week from Missouri.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An amusing incident occurred at the close of Sam
Jones’ sermon at Pulaski. Stepping down from the
pulpit, folding his hands across his breast, and looking
solemnly over the audience, the great revivalist
said—</p>

<p>I want all the women in this crowd who have not
spoken a harsh word or harbored an unkind thought
toward their husbands for a month past to stand up.</p>

<p>One old woman, apparently on the shady side of
sixty, stood up.</p>

<p>Come forward and give me your hand, said the
preacher.</p>

<p>The woman did so, whereupon Jones said—</p>

<p>Now turn around and let this audience see the
best-looking woman in the country.</p>

<p>After taking her seat, the revivalist addressed the
men—</p>

<p>Now I want all the men in this crowd who have
not spoken a harsh word or harbored an unkind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
thought toward their wives for a month past to
stand up.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven great big strapping fellows hopped
out of the audience with all the alacrity of champagne
corks.</p>

<p>Come forward and give me your hands, my dear
boys.</p>

<p>Jones gave each one a vigorous shake, after which
he ranged all of them side by side in front of the
pulpit and facing the audience. He looked them
over carefully and solemnly, and then, turning around
to the audience, he said—</p>

<p>I want you all to take a good look at the twenty-seven
biggest liars in the State of Tennessee.</p>

Go along with you. You can’t fool us.</p>

Solomon’s robe, an earring of the Queen of Sheba,
Absalom’s hairpin, David’s sling, and so on. In the

<p>Right, sir. ’Tis a great place here. We count a

<p>Is that so, said he, wonderingly. Well, it’s money

<p>Sure, replied St. Peter, in a minute.</p>

<p>Pat came to the wake. He walked up to the
bier and looking at the remains of his buddie, Mike,
he burst out laughing. He was prompt-hustled out
of the room by many strong hands and when he got
his breath he explained: Well, you see, the last time
I talked with Mike he argied with me that there
wasn’t no heaven and there wasn’t no hell, and I
couldn’t kape from laffin’ when I see him lyin’ there
all dressed up and no where to go.</p>

<p>Two Irishmen were on a ship coming over to
America. One night Mike awoke Pat and said, Pat,
get up quick, the ship is sinking. Pat said, what do

<p>The little Irishman was being examined for admission
to the army. He seemed all right in every way
except one. The doctor said, you’re a little stiff.
Quickly the Irish blood mounted as the applicant

<p>R. Hinton Perry, the sculptor, is responsible for
the following story of the scrublady who cares for
his studio.</p>

<p>How many children have you Mrs. O’Flarity?

<p>It’s siven I have, sir, she replied. Four be the

<p>Two young men met an Irishman. Said one:
Well, Pat, what’s the news?</p>

<p>Divil a bit, yer honors; ’tis very dull in these parts.
Have yez any news?</p>

<p>Yes, Pat; some very important news.</p>

<p>Is that so, yer honors? Phat is it?</p>

<p>We heard awhile ago for a fact that the devil was
dead.</p>

<p>Is that so? Och, worra, worra! What a pity,
said he, taking out some money and giving to each a
quarter.</p>

<p>Oh, Pat, take back your money; we don’t charge
you anything.</p>

<p>Och, I know yez don’t; but ’twas a custom in the
old country to give the orphans something when their
father died.</p>

<p>An Irishman who was signing articles on board a
ship began to write his name with his right hand,
then, changing the pen to his left hand, finished it.</p>

<p>So you can write with either hand, Pat? asked

<p>A good old Irish pastor was thanking his congregation
for the many Easter offerings, and his tremulous
voice told how great was his pleasure.</p>

<p>I want to thank the congregation, he said, for the
many beautiful gifts from my people this glorious
Easter Sunday. The plate donations were far in
excess of my expectations, the candles were many
and freely contributed, and the flowers were simply
beautiful; but I want to say right here and now that
the thing that touched my heart the most was whin
little Mar-r-y Killy walked oop the aisle an’ laid an
egg on the altar.</p>

<p>Two Irishmen, long enemies, met one day. Said
one: What’s the sinse of two intilligint min goin’
along year after year like a couple of wildcats spittin’
at each other? Here we live in the same tinimint,
and ’tis a burnin’ shame that we do be actin’ like a
couple of boobies. Come along wid yer and shake
hands, and we’ll make up and be friends. Which
they did, and went to an adjacent public house to
cement their friendship with a glass of grog. Both
stood at the bar in silence. One looked at the other
and said:</p>

<p>What are you thinkin’ about?</p>

<p>Oi’m thinkin’ the same thing that you are.</p>

<p>Oh, so ye’re startin’ agin, are ye?</p>

<p>The frequent and unsuccessful candidacy of
certain men in this town for public office reminded
George (Scotty) Dore of a story of his friend Hogan.</p>

<p>Hogan was raffling a clock, said Mr. Dore. He
was fairly successful in disposing of tickets in the
shop where he worked, but he ran up against trouble
when he canvassed his neighbors.</p>

<p>Dropping in at a neighbor’s house, he tried to
sell a ticket on the clock.</p>

<p>It’s a fine timepiece, and it’ll luk foine on yer
what-not er mantel, says Hogan, cajolingly.</p>

<p>Gwan, the old clock doesn’t run! replied the
neighbor.</p>

<p>Well, drawled Hogan, changing front completely,
well perhaps yez won’t win it, and then
ye’ll have the laugh on the fellow who does.</p>

<p>Street cleaning commissioner Paul Inglehart, of
Baltimore, returned recently from a gunning trip
in Anne Arundel county and brought with him a
supply of new stories told in the historic old South
River Club.</p>

<p>The one that particularly took Mr. Inglehart’s
fancy was that of the Irish servant girl who one
day asked her mistress what was the meaning of
the word “kismet”. After thinking a little while the
mistress said:</p>

<p>Why, Bridget, it is another name for fate.</p>

<p>A day or so afterward the mistress discovered
Bridget hobbling down the stairs evidently in great
pain and walking very lame.</p>

<p>Why, what on earth is the matter with you?
she asked.</p>

<p>Oh, sure, ma’am, was the reply, I’ve got bunions
on my kismet.</p>

<p>How is this? the detective inquired, with a jerk of
his thumb toward the interior of the car.</p>

<p>How’s what? inquired the Irishman.</p>

<p>Nine passengers got on and you only rung up
eight fares.</p>

<p>Is that so, responded the conductor, with a look
of innocent surprise. He cautiously counted the
fares on the large dial. The spotter was waiting.
Begorra, yer right. Wan of thim has got to git off.</p>

<p>Thomas Patrick Gallagher, typical Irish traffic
copper, was stationed on Madison street in Chicago
at the point intersected by the river.</p>

<p>One bustling Saturday afternoon, Gallagher held
up his hand to halt traffic for the draw bridge. In
front of him was a new handsome limousine motor car.</p>

<p>While waiting for the bridge to close, a runabout
flivver crashed into the rear end of the handsome car.</p>

<p>Gallagher was on the job promptly and hustled
over to the driver of the flivver.</p>

<p>Phwat in hal does yez mane by smashing into
this handsome car? Haven’t you got any eyes?
he bellowed at the meek and humble driver. Are
you crazy? I’ve a good mind to take you down
to the headquarters, you blithering idiot. What’s
your name? continued Gallagher, as he extracted
a pencil and notebook from his pocket, what is
the number of your car?</p>

<p>The answer back in typical Gaelic, me name
is Clancy.</p>

<p>Clancy, replied Gallagher. Clancy, what part
of Ireland are you from, what county—</p>

<p>I am from County Mayo.</p>

<p>County Mayo, continued the traffic officer,
County Mayo, say Clancy, stay here just a minute
till I go head to that big car and see why in the devil
he backed into you.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is illustrative of eviction
days in Ireland. Pat had served part of his time
as a bricklayer in the old country. On arrival in
America, he was watching some bricklayers at
work when the foreman observed him:</p>

<p>Can they do it as quick as that in Ireland, Pat?</p>

<p>They can indeed, and twice as quick, answered Pat.</p>

<p>Do you know, said the foreman, that we start
a house here in the morning and it’s finished and
a tenant in it before evening.</p>

<p>That’s all you can do, is it? Well, said Pat,
in Ireland we start a house in the morning and
the landlord is evicting the tenant for back rent
before evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Strange as it may seem, there is a public man in
this city who is blessed or cursed with a tender conscience
that worries him in small matters as well as
in great. Among the things that he cannot justify
to himself is the bidding a servant to say he is not at
home when, in reality, he is inside his house. At
the same time he is not able to receive the many
visitors who call upon him, and his only recourse was
to give instructions that polite excuses should be
given to a maid, an Irish girl, gifted with the readiness
and good-will of her nation.</p>

<p>Then I’m to be saying, sir, that you’re not at
home? the maid inquired.</p>

<p>No, Mary, no! was the reply; that would not be
true. If anyone should ask for me, you must just
put him off—give him some evasive answer, you know.</p>

<p>I’ll do it, sir, never fear, was the maid’s reply.
Mary was as good as her word.</p>

<p>That afternoon a person of importance made his
appearance, and was duly sent away. The faithful
maid reported the circumstance to her employer.</p>

<p>What did you do, Mary? inquired the latter with
some trepidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>Oh, I just put him off, sir, as you told me. I
gave him an evasive answer.</p>

<p>Yes, but what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Oh, sure, he axed me if the boss was at home, and
I said to him, was his grandmother a monkey?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were some deficiencies in the early education
of Mrs. Donahoe, but she never mentioned them
or admitted their existence.</p>

<p>Will you sign your name here? said the young
lawyer whom Mrs. Donahoe had asked to draw up
a deed transferring a parcel of land to her daughter.</p>

<p>You sign it yoursilf an I’ll make me mark, said
the old woman, quickly. Since me eyes gave out
I’m not able to write a wurrd, young man.</p>

<p>How do you spell it? he asked, pen poised above
the proper space.</p>

<p>Spell it what iver way you plaze, said Mrs.
Donahoe, recklessly. Since I lost me teeth there’s
not a wurrd in the wurrld I can spell.</p>

<p>A story is going the rounds in the court house
of an Irishman who recently went before Judge
Stephens to be naturalized.</p>

<p>Have you read the Declaration of Independence?
the Court asked.</p>

<p>I hov not, said Pat.</p>

<p>Have you read the Constitution of the United
States?</p>

<p>I hov not, your honer.</p>

<p>Judge Stephens looked sternly at the applicant
and asked:</p>

<p>Well, what have you read?</p>

<p>Patrick hesitated but the fraction of a second
before replying:</p>

<p>I hov red hairs on me neck, yer honor.</p>

They wouldn’t put a funeral off for a week.</p>

How can you be so heartless as to arrange to attend

may not die at all.</p>

<p>Yas’m, but he will; dey ain’t no hope.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say that, Eliza; the best doctors
are often mistaken. But even if they do know
a case to be hopeless, they cannot predict the exact
time of a man’s death with such a certainty that the
funeral can be arranged so long beforehand.</p>

<p>Yas’m, with calm assurance; but he will be buried

<p>The ballot box had been passed and the worshipful

Brother Junior Warden? Clar in the south, worshipful.
How is the ballot in the west, Brother Senior
Warden? Clar in the west, worshipful. The W. M.
then inspected the box and said—And clar in the
east. I therefore declar Mr. Josephus Johnson duly
elected to take the degrees in this lodge. Up jumped
a big coon, as black as the ace of spades, and cried,
That’s a ’fernal lie,’ worshipful master. I put in

<p>Edward M. Flesh, of the United States Food
Commission, was talking in St. Louis about snobbishness.</p>

<p>Snobbishness penetrates everywhere, he said. It
even penetrates our churches.</p>

<p>I know of an old darky who got religion last
month and decided to join the church. He selected,
of course, the richest and handsomest church in
town, the church with the finest music and the best
preaching. Then he called on the pastor and stated
his design.</p>

<p>But the pastor hemmed and hawed. He felt that
his fashionable flock wouldn’t welcome such an addition
as the old darky. He didn’t want to hurt the
old fellow’s feelings, however, and finally he said—</p>

<p>Go home, Uncle Rooster. Go home and pray
over it. This is an important matter, and it should
be made a subject of prayer.</p>

<p>Old Uncle Rooster went home, and in a few days
he was back again.</p>

<p>At the end of the first six months of his pastorate
in Kentucky the Rev. Silas Johns had learned the
ways of his flock so thoroughly that he knew exactly
how to deal with them. One Sunday the collection
was deplorably small. The next week he made a
short and telling speech at the close of his sermon.
I don’t want any man to gib more dan his share,

but we must all gib according as we are
favored and according to what we rightly hab. I

de box. Squire Blinks told me dat he’d missed some
chickens dis week. Now, if any one ob my pore

<p>An excellent story is told by Kate Douglas Wiggin,
the popular writer. A negro servant, wishing
to get married, asked his master to buy him a license
in the neighboring town. The master, being in haste,
did not ask the name of the happy woman, but as he
drove along he reflected on the many tender attentions
that he had seen John lavish upon Euphemia
Wilson, the cook, and, concluding that there could
be no mistake, had the license made out in her name.</p>

<p>There’s your license to marry Euphemia, he said
to the servant that night. You’re as good as married
already, and you owe me only two dollars.</p>

<p>The darky’s face fell.</p>

<p>But, Mas’ Tom, Euphemia Wilson ain’t de lady
I’se gwine to marry. Dat wan’t nothin’ mo’n a
little flirtation. Georgiana Thompson, the la’ndress,
is the one I’se gwine to marry.</p>

<p>Oh, well, John, said the master, amused and
irritated at the same time, there’s no great harm
done. I’ll get you another license to-morrow, but
it will cost you two dollars more, of course.</p>

carriage as it was starting for town, and leaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
confidentially over the wheel, said—Mas’ Tom, you

tell you de troof, Mas’ Tom, de conclusion o’ my

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Until recently there was a partnership existing
between two darky blacksmiths in an Alabama town.
The dissolution of this association was made known
by a notice nailed upon the door of the smithy, which
notice ran as follows—</p>

<p>The kopardnershipp heretofor resisting between
me and Mose Jenkins is heerby resolved. All perrsons
owing the firm will settel with me, and all
perrsons that the firm owes to will settel with Mose.</p>

<p>I wonder if you know that Betty Botter baked
a bit of batter, but her batter was so bitter that to
make her bitter batter better Betty Botter bought a
bit of better butter, and with this bit of better butter
Betty Botter made her bitter batter better.</p>

<p>In reply to the question, How much wood would
a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would chuck
wood? I would say, if a woodchuck would chuck
all the wood that a woodchuck could chuck if a
woodchuck could chuck wood, a woodchuck would
chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if
a woodchuck could chuck wood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the tramp begged for somthun to do for a
bite o’ bread, the lady of the house said—Did you
happen to notice that pile of wood in the yard?</p>

<p>Yes’m, I seen it.</p>

<p>You should mind your grammar. You mean you
saw it.</p>

<p>No’m. You saw me see it, but you ain’t seen me
saw it.</p>

<p>An old farmer of Arkansas, whose sons had all
grown up and left him, hired a young man by the
name of Esau Buck to help him on his farm. On
the evening of the first day they hauled up a small
load of poles for wood, and unloaded them. The
next morning the old man said to the hired man—</p>

<p>Esau, I’m going to town today, and while I am
gone you may saw wood and keep the old ram out
of the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>When the old man had gone, Esau went out to
saw the wood, but when he saw the saw he wouldn’t
saw. When Esau saw the saw he couldn’t saw with
that saw. Esau looked around for another saw, but
that was the only saw he saw, so he didn’t saw.
When the old man came home he said to Esau—</p>

<p>Esau, did you saw the wood?</p>

<p>Esau said—I saw the wood, but I wouldn’t saw it.</p>

<p>The old man went out to see the saw, and when
he saw the saw he saw that Esau couldn’t saw with
that saw. When Esau saw that the old man saw
that he couldn’t saw with the saw, Esau picked up
the ax and chopped up the wood and made a seesaw.</p>

<p>The next day the old man went to town and bought
a new buck-saw for Esau Buck, and when he came
home he hung the buck-saw for Esau Buck on the
saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>Just at that time Esau Buck saw the old buck in
the garden eating cabbage, and when driving him
from the garden to the barn-yard Esau Buck saw
the buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>When the old buck saw Esau Buck looking at the
new buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw, he
made a dive for Esau, hit the seesaw, knocked the
seesaw against Esau Buck, who fell on the buck-saw
on the saw-buck by the seesaw.</p>

<p>When the old man saw the old buck dive at Esau
Buck, and miss Esau and hit the seesaw and knock
the seesaw against Esau, and Esau Buck fall on the
buck-saw on the saw-buck by the seesaw, he picked
up an ax to kill the old buck. But the buck saw
him coming and dodged the blow and countered on
the old man’s stomach, knocked the old man over
the seesaw onto Esau Buck, who was getting the
seesaw, crippled Esau Buck, broke the buck-saw and
the saw-buck and the seesaw.</p>

<p>A Yale student is reported to be responsible for
the following alliteration—</p>

<p>Bill had a billboard. Bill also had a board bill.
The board bill bored Bill so that Bill sold the bill
board to pay the board bill. So after Bill sold the
bill board to pay his board bill the board bill no
longer bored Bill.</p>

<p>It is said that with little practice on either exercise
a salesman will so loosen his tongue and grease his
vocal organs that he can sell Russian bonds to a
Japanese.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
